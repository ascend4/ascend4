Description:Solver for systems of equations and ODEs/DAEs
 ASCEND is a modelling and simulation environment for
 solving systems of nonlinear equations. It includes
 a modelling language, in which you write the equations
 that represent your system-to-be-modelled, as well as
 a user interface that lets to interact with your model,
 solve it, adjust values, and report results. There is also
 a model library with many example problems, and a database of
 thermodynamic properties for various materials.
 .
 ASCEND was developed at Carnegie Mellon University starting
 in the 1980s and continues as an active open source project.
 .
 This package includes both the mature Tcl/Tkl GUI and
 the newer PyGTK-based GUI, as well as documentation
 and the model library.
 .

 This package contains header files and shared libraries to allow developers to
 compile against libascend, for example when creating ASCEND 'external
 libraries' or programs that depend on ASCEND.
