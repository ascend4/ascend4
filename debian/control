Description:Solver for systems of equations and ODEs/DAEs
 ASCEND is a modelling and simulation environment for
 solving systems of nonlinear equations. It includes
 a modelling language, in which you write the equations
 that represent your system-to-be-modelled, as well as
 a user interface that lets to interact with your model,
 solve it, adjust values, and report results. There is also
 a model library with many example problems, and a database of
 thermodynamic properties for various materials.
 .
 ASCEND was developed at Carnegie Mellon University starting
 in the 1980s and continues as an active open source project.
 .
 This package includes both the mature Tcl/Tkl GUI and
 the newer PyGTK-based GUI, as well as documentation
 and the model library.

 This package contains header files and shared libraries to allow developers to
 compile against libascend, for example when creating ASCEND 'external
 libraries' or programs that depend on ASCEND.

 This package contains the somewhat outdated Tcl/Tk GUI for ASCEND, which
 although no longer maintained is still very useful in some cases.
