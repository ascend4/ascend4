Description:
  ASCEND is a modelling and simulation environment for
  solving systems of nonlinear equations. It includes
  a modelling language, in which you write the equations
  that represent your system-to-be-modelled, as well as
  a user interface that lets to interact with your model,
  solve it, adjust values, and report results.
  .
  This package includes both the mature Tcl/Tkl GUI and
  the newer PyGTK-based GUI, as well as documentation
  and the model library.
