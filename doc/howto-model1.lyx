\begin_layout Standard
You read our propaganda about the ASCEND system in which we said it was
 to help technical people create hard models.
 We said you can tackle really large models -- 100,000 equations, compiling
 and solving them in minutes on a PC.
 We also pointed out that you can readily solve the small problems many
 currently solve using a spreadsheet, only once posed you can solve them
 inside out, upside down and backwards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sounded intriguing so you downloaded the system and installed it.
 Hopefully, this proved quite straight forward.
 You double-clicked the ASCEND icon on your desktop and started it up for
 the first time.
 Four windows opened up.
 You panicked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who wouldn't? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this system properly requires that you learn how to use it.
 If you pay the price to do so - and we hope it is not a large price, then
 we believe you will find the tools we have provided to help you create
 and debug models will pay you back handsomely.

We strongly suggest you put time aside and go through all three of these
 early chapters to introduce yourself to ASCEND.
 It should take you about two to three hours.
 The second chapter is particularly important if you wish to understand
 our approach to good modeling practices.

Step 2: 
\emph on
This model is to become a part of a library of models which others can use
 in the future.
 You must document it.
 You must add methods to it to make it easy for others to make it well-posed.
 You should probably parameterize it, and finally you must create a script
 which anyone can easily run that solves an example problem to illustrate
 its use.

Every ASCEND model is, in fact, a type definition.
 To "solve a model," we make an instance

 of a type and solve the instance.
 So we shall start by creating a vessel type definition.
 We will have to create our type definition as a text file using a text
 editor.

type definition library for variables and constants
\end_layout

ASCEND considers variable and constant types to be elementary or "atomic"
 to the system.
 These type definitions can contain only attributes for variables and constants.
 They cannot contain equations, for example.
 Thus ASCEND calls such a type definition an atom rather than a model.

 There is no solution procedure buried in this type definition.
 In ASCEND the idea of solving is separate from saying what we intend to
 solve.
 Also note that we have not said anything about the values for any of the

The Solver window contains the information we need to see to explain why
 the Eligible window opened in the first place.
 Examine the information the Solver displays.
 It tells you that 
\family typewriter
v
\family default
 has 6 relations defining it and that all are equalities and included.
 It has no inequalities.
 On the right side we see there are 10 variables and all are 'free
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "free variables"

\end_inset

.' A free variable is one for which you want the system to compute a value.
 Hmm, 6 equations in 10 variables.
 Something is wrong here.
 For a well-posed problem, you want 6 equations in 6 variables (i.e., square
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "square"

\end_inset

).
 ASCEND reports that the system is underspecified
\begin_inset LatexCommand index

\end_inset

 by 4.
 This means you need to pick four of the variables and declare them to be
 fixed
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "fixed"

\end_inset

.
 You will also have to pick values for these fixed variables before you
 can solve for the remaining 6.
 For such a small problem as this one, this task is not formidable.
 For a model with 50,000 equations and 60,000 variables, one would quit
 and go home.
 We have exposed a need here.
 We certainly would like ASCEND to help us here for this small problem.
 But we insist that it help us in major ways to make the 50,000 equation,

\end_inset

Okay, the small help such as needed here is why the Eligible window opened.
 Let's return to it.
 It lists all the variables of those not yet fixed that are eligible to
 be fixed and still leave us a calculation that has a chance to solve.
 The algorithm to find eligible variables does an quick analysis of the
 structure of the equations.
 The variables it lists are those that can be fixed 
\emph on
without
\emph default
 the system becoming numerically singular.
 So any variables that are not shown 
\emph on
cannot possibly
\emph default
 help you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So look at the list and decide what you would like to fix for your first
 calculation with this model.
 Diameter (
\family typewriter
v.D
\family default
) seems a good choice.
 Now you can see why we called the instance just plain old 
\family typewriter
v
\family default
.
 A longer name would get tiring here.
 Anyway, pick 
\family typewriter
v.D
\family default
.
 Immediately the list reappears with 
\family typewriter
v.D
\family default
 no longer on it.
 ASCEND has just repeated the eligibility analysis, and found that more
 variables still need to be fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have three more to pick.
 On the list are both vessel height, 
\family typewriter
v.H
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
v.H_to_D_ratio
\family default
.
 We certainly cannot pick both of these.
 One implies the other if we know a value for 
\family typewriter
v.D
\family default
.
 Pick 
\family typewriter
v.H_to_D_ratio
\family default
.
 Note that 
\family typewriter
v.H
\family default
 is no longer eligible.
 Good.
 We would be worried if it were still there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see 
\family typewriter
v.metal_density
\emph on
.

\family default
\emph default
 Pick it.
 Strange.
 Metal mass and volume stayed eligible.
 Why? If we pick metal mass, wall thickness is implied, and the same is
 true if we were to pick metal volume.
 However, as it seems much more natural to pick 
\family typewriter
wall_thickness
\family default
, make that the last variable you choose.
 The Solver window now says this problem is square (i.e., it has 6 equations
 in the same number of unknowns).

 has discovered that not all the equations have to be solved simultaneously.
 There are 6 blocks of equations which it can solve in sequence.
 6 blocks and 6 equations means that ASCEND has found a way to solve the
 model by solving 6 individual equations in sequence -- i.e., one at a time.
 This is a good thing: it usually means that the solver will have less problems
 with locating the overall solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As well as breaking down the system into blocks, ASCEND has the ability
 to rearrange some simple algebraic equations so that unknown variables
 can be evaluated directly from the known values, with no need for iterative
 numerical methods.
 This is only possible if there is just one equation in the block.

There are two ways you can reset the units for displaying length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Length is a basic dimension in ASCEND so under the 
\emph on
Display
\emph default
 button select Length.
 A side window will open with all the alternate units supported in ASCEND
 for length.
 Select ft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Or, in the lower part of the Units window is a frame labeled 'Set units'.
 Clear and then type 
\family typewriter
ft
\family default
 then hit Enter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In either way, the units for all length variables will switch to ft.
 Look at the values in the Browser window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The left upper window of the Units window contains many variable types that
 have composite dimensions.
 For example, you will find volume there.
 Pick it and the right window fills with all the alternative units in which
 you can express volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Play with changing the units for displaying the various variables in the
 vessel instance v.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One point - the left window displaying types having composite dimensions
 will display only one type for each composite dimension.
 If the atom types you have loaded were to include volume_difference as
 well as volume, then only one of the two types, volume or volume_difference,
 will be listed here.
 Changing the units to express either changes the units for both.

now we can solve the model in other ways
\end_layout

\end_inset

We can now resolve our vessel instance in any number of different ways.
 For example we can ask what the diameter would be if we had a volume of
 
\emph on
250 ft3
\emph default
.
 To accomplish this calculation, we need first to make 
\emph on
vessel_volume
\emph default
 a variable whose value we wish to fix.
 When we do this the model will be overspecified.
 ASCEND will indicate this problem to us and offer us a list of variables
 - including the vessel diameter 
\emph on
D
\emph default
, one of which we will have to "unfix
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "unfix"

\end_inset

." Finally we need to alter the value of 
\emph on
vessel_volume
\emph default
 to the desired value and solve.
 Explicit instructions to accomplish these steps are as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the 
\series bold
Browser
\series default
 window, make 
\emph on
vessel_volume
\emph default
 the current object (select it using the left mouse button).
 The right window of the 
\series bold
Browser
\series default
 display the parts of the 
\emph on
vessel_volume
\emph default
, among them is the fixed flag with a value of 
\emph on
FALSE
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(If you do not see the value for fixed but rather its type as a boolean,
 under the 
\emph on
View
\emph default
 button at the top, select 
\emph on
Display Atom Values.
\emph default
) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pick fixed with the right mouse button, and, in the small window that opens,
 delete the value 
\emph on
FALSE
\emph default
, enter the value 
\emph on
TRUE
\emph default
 and select 
\emph on
OK
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Now make v the current object by picking it in the left window of the 
\series bold
Browser
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Export v to the Solver again by selecting to Solver under the Export button.
 A window entitled Overspecified
\begin_inset LatexCommand index
name "Overspecified"

\end_inset

 will appear listing the variables v.D, v.H_to_D_ratio and v.vessel_volume.
 Pick v.D and hit the OK button; ASCEND will reset its fixed flag to FALSE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, return to the 
\series bold
Browser
\series default
 window and select 
\emph on
vessel_volume
\emph default
 with the right mouse button.
 In the small window that appears type 
\emph on
250
\emph default
 in the left window, 
\emph on
ft^3
\emph default
 in the right, and hit the 
\emph on
OK
\emph default
 button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Under the 
\emph on
Execute
\emph default
 button in the 
\series bold
Solver
\series default
 window, select 
\emph on
Solve
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note the 
\series bold
Solver
\series default
 reports only 4 blocks for 6 equations.
 This time it has to solve some equations simultaneously.
 In the 
\series bold
Solver
\series default
 window, under the 
\emph on
Display
\emph default
 button, select the 
\emph on
Incidence matrix
\emph default
 tool.
 You will see that the first three equations must be solved together as
 a single block of equations.

\end_layout

\end_inset

For a more complicated model you may wish to start over on the process of
 selecting which variables are fixed.
 You can set the fixed flags for all the variables in a problem to FALSE
 all at once -- without knowing which are currently set to TRUE.
 In the Browser window, under the Edit button, select the Run method tool.
 A window will open that displays a list of default methods that are automatical
ly attached to every model in ASCEND.
 One is called ClearAll.
 Pick it and hit OK.
 All the fixed flags for the entire model will now be reset to FALSE.
 Can you think of a way to check if this is true? (Do you remember how to
 check which variables are currently fixed? Repeat that check and you should
 find no variables are on the list.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might now want to play by changing what you calculate and fix.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have just completed the creation and solving of a very small model in
 ASCEND.
 In doing so, you have been exposed to some interesting issues.
 How can we separate the concept of the model from how we intend to solve
 it? How do we make a model to be well-posed -- i.e., a model involving n
 equations in n unknowns -- so we can solve it? How should one handle the
 units for the variables in a modeling system? What we have shown you here
 is for a small model.
 We still need to show you how one can make a large model well-posed, for
 example.
 You will start to understand how one can do this in the next chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next chapter is crucial for you to understand if you want to begin to
 understand how we approach good modeling practice.
 Please do continue with it.
 As it uses the vessel model, it would, of course, be best to continue with
 that chapter now.
