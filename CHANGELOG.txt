Version 0.9.5.112

Solver interface
 - all solvers and integrators are now built as 'external library' DLL/SOs.
 - new ASCENDSOLVERS environment variable gives additional search path location
   that is checked when attempting to satisfy IMPORT statements.
 - Fixed behaviour scons when lex/yacc not available.
 - Many ASC_DLLSPEC qualifiers added as result of the expanded use of external
   libraries.

Solvers
 - CONOPT no longer needs to be present at buildtime. This was possible due
   to permission from Arne Drud to add the 'conopt.h' file to our source code.
 - BLAS and LINPACK are now embedded in the LSODE DLL/SO. They are not
   part of libascend, which makes the main DLL about 1 MB smaller.
 - Some bugs in the DOPRI5 integrator identified (full testing still not
   completed).
 - placeholder for a future TRON solver (work still to do on that)
 - work underway on the IPOPT optimisation solver.

Model library
 - Equations of state models from Krishnan.
 - Added ASCEND port of the standard GAMS example problem.
 
Windows installer
 - Added ability to download and install missing dependencies. This
   makes getting started with ASCEND much simpler for new users.
 - Added the user's manual (in PDF form) to the installer package.

RPM package
 - A SUNDIALS RPM package has been submitted for inclusion in Fedora, making
   installation of ASCEND possible with a single download on that distro.
 - RPM divided into subpackages ascend, ascend-devel, ascend-doc.
 - Other work on building RPMs for a range of Linux platforms using
   the new OpenSUSE Build Service.

DEB package
 - Fixed.
