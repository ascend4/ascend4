	Binary tokens implementation for real relation instances.
	
	Note that this header and btprolog.h are a pair.
	btprolog exists to make the C compiler job simpler -
	we don't want it to know about struct Instance when
	building code because we may not have the compiler
	directory available. btprolog.h is installed with
	the ascend binaries or scripts.
