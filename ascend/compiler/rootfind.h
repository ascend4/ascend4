/**< Find a root in a given interval using Brent's method.

	Using Brents method, find the root of a function known to lie
	between x1 and x2. The root, returned as zbrent, will be refined
	until its accuracy is tol. The result of status must be monitored
	to see if we were successful. A nonzero code means that the result
	returned is erroneous. n is the index into the x vector of the variable
	that is to be solved for.

	@param func      The evaluation function.
	@param lowbound  Lower bound.
	@param upbound   Upper bound.
	@param mode      Passed to the eval func.
	@param m         The relation index.
	@param n         The variable index.
	@param x         The x vector -- needed by eval func.
	@param u         The u vector -- needed by eval func.
	@param f         Vector of residuals.
	@param g         Vector of gradients.
	@param tolerance Accuracy of solution.
	@param status    Success or failure.
	@return          The location of the found root (see also status code)
