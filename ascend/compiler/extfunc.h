	External Functions Module.

        This module implements the ExternalFunc structure referenced by
        black and glass box structures and external methods.
        The ExternalFunc structure stores the number of input and
        output parameters (formal)
        as well as 'help' string and 'name' string' for each of these 'calls'.

	This header also provides functions for ExternalFunc library maintenance.
	This allows ASCEND to maintain a list of the ExternalFunc requests derived
	from statements in the model(s). When compilation completes, I suppose
	it should be possible to alert the user about any external functions
	that were not able to be resolved.

	@todo Complete documentation of compiler/extfunc.h.
