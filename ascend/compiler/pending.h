	Ascend Pending Instance Routines.

	The pending list is implemented as a doubly linked list.
	Clients of this module should NOT access the internals of this list.
	They should not access next and prev in particular.
	Note that only complex types (models, arrays) and not atomic ones
	(atoms, relations, constants) should ever be put on the list.
	No client should ever free a struct pending_t *. That is our job.

	Requires:
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
	#include "instance_enum.h"
	#include "compiler.h"
