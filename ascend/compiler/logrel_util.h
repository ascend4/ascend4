/*
 *  Calculation of the Logical Residuals of a logical relation :
 *  LogRelCalcResidualPostfix
 *  LogRelCalcResidualInfix
 *  and calculation of the values(s) of a boolean variable which make a
 *  logical relation to be satisfied:
 *  LogRelFindBoolValues
 *
 *  IMPORTANT:
 *  The solution of conditional model implicates the presence of
 *  SATISFIED terms (satisfaction of Boundary conditions)
 *  in some of the logical relations. Because the freedom that the
 *  modeling language gives to the user, sometimes is very difficult
 *  to know if the change of the truth value of a SATISFIED term is
 *  really meaningful to the configuration of the conditional problem.
 *  A boundary may be crossed, but still the boolean dependent on that
 *  condition may not change; furthermore, even a change in that boolean
 *  may not affect the configuration of the problem because a change
 *  of configuration may require the satisfaction of several conditions
 *  simultaneously.
 *  The easier way to test if the crossing of a boundary affects the current
 *  configuration is to solve the logical relations assuming such a
 *  crossing and finding if the configuration of the problem changes.
 *  This task is performed here by using the "perturb" flag and a list
 *  of pointers to the relation instance which constitutes the boundary(ies).
 *  The activation of the perturbation flag causes the calculation
 *  routines to INVERT the truth value of the SATISFIED terms containing
 *  the relation instances pointed by the list of pointers.
 *  The flag and the list of pointers are needed because the SATISFIED term
 *  is not an instance by itself and we have access to it only trough the
 *  logrel instance.
 *  Another option would be to modify the values of the variables incident
 *  in the boundary until the truth value of the SATISFIED changes by itself,
 *  but this would have to be iteratively (i.e. more expensive), since it
 *  would be required to perform  gradient calculations in
 *  order to know how the change of the value of some variable will modify
 *  the residual of the boundary. Other question that we would need to
 *  answer is how many variables should be modified simultaneously,etc.
 *  Notice that this is not necessary because we do not care about a change
 *  in the real values of the variables incident in the boundary (and, as
 *  a matter of fact, we do not want ot modify the current values), we only
 *  want to know what would it happen with the value of logical variables
 *  if the truth value of the SATISFIED term changes.
 *
 *  A third option would be to keep the information about the number
 *  of subregions in the conditional model and the values for the booleans
 *  which make them active. This is unaceptable for problems involving
 *  a big number of boundary conditions, since the problem is combinatorial.
 *
 *  IN GENERAL, ANY USER INTERESTED IN THESE CALCULATION ROUTINES FOR
 *  PURPOSES OF SOLVING PURE LOGIC PROBLEMS (NOT CONTAINING BOUNDARIES),
 *  SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE
 *  PARAMETERS EXPLAINED ABOVE. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT HE/SHE SHOULD
 *  USE THE MACRO
 *  LogRelCalcResidual
 *  WHICH CALL THE CALCULATION ROUTINES WITHOUT CONSIDERING THOSE
