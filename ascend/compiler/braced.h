*//** @file
	Module for storing braced text of notes and some other 
	BRACEDTEXT_T applications.

	What we're calling "braced text" is just a regular C char* augmented with a 
	language attribute and string length, and with reference counting.
	
	Not everything that is defined as BRACEDTEXT_T in the grammar is necessarily
	kept by using this module. For example, some units END up in the symbol 
	table.
	
	'struct bracechar' is defined first in compiler.h, to hide the details of
	whatever it is we do with braced text in composing NOTES and other
	persistent forms.

	Braced text may be very long.
