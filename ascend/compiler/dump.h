	Instance Garbage Dump

	This is a resting place for un-needed instances.  They may be stored in
	the dump in case they are needed later on.  Only pure instance should
	be stored in the dump, and the dumping procedure is responsible for
	making sure that the instance it "pure", and unconnected to anything
	else.  Typically, these restrictions are only met by atoms.
