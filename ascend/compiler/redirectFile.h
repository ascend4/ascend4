*//** @file
	File redirection for ascend.

	This module defines the fundamental constants used by the rest of
	Ascend and pulls in system headers.
	There is not corresponding compiler.c. The variables
	declared in this header are defined in ascParse.y.

	This header and tcl/tk headers are known to conflict. This header
	should be included AFTER tcl.h or tk.h, not before.

	Requires:
	#include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
