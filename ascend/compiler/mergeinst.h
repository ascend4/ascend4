 *  for type compatibility.
 *  This operator is MOSTLY BROKEN due to the addition of
 *  parameterized types. In particular, MoreRefined needs to be
 *  augmented to check args that are now part of the extended
 *  type definition.
 *  This may add to or change the pending instance list.
 *  If the return is NULL, the state of i1 and i2 in structural
 *  terms is highly questionable. They may be partially merged.
 *
 *  @bug Merging two vars in a shared relation will mess up all the
 *       other copies of the relation unless all of their corresponding
 *       vars are also merged. Fixed for token relations, but not others.
