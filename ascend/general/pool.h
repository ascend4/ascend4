 *  Ascend Pooled Memory Manager.
 *  <pre>
 *  Contents:     Pool Memory module
 *
 *  Authors:      Benjamin Andrew Allan
 *
 *  Dates:        05/95 - original version: utilities/mem.[ch]
 *                        nearly generic element allocation routines.
 *                02/96 - copied to compiler and swapped pool for mem in
 *                        names. deleted all the Karl foo of mem.c.
 *                03/96 - retuned some of the parameters for compiler.
 *
 *  Description:  This generic element memory manager is yet another
 *                implementation of a fixed byte size malloc system
 *                that is more efficient than most standard mallocs. This
 *                is possible because we make the fixed size assumption.
 *                The idea is clearly not original.
 *                For best results, you must understand your memory
 *                usage pattern and tune the pool_create_store() parameters
 *                accordingly.
 *
 *                This has similar functionality to free_store.[ch] but
 *                is a rather more efficient implementation with a better
 *                interface. The mem_ implementation of this code
 *                remains in utilities/ because the solvers (which may
 *                also stand alone) need to be able to link without the
 *                compiler goop.
 *
 *  Detailed Description:
 *
 *  The following definitions provide a generic and reasonably efficient memory
 *  allocation system for situations where many many objects of the same size
 *  need to be "allocated and deallocated" rapidly and stored efficiently:
 *  that is to say when normal malloc is too slow and expensive.
 *  This scheme does not play reference count games. Instead any elements that
 *  have been created and then used and subsequently "freed" go on a list
 *  and are handed out again at the next opportunity. The list is run LIFO.
 *  The list is associated with the pool_store_t.
 *
 *  There is one restriction on the elements: they will be a multiple of the
 *  size of a pointer, even if you specify otherwise. If this is too large,
 *  write your own allocator. Think about how your elements align. On many
 *  architectures doubles should only be stored at addresses that are
 *  multiples of 8 bytes.
 *  There is the implicit restriction on a store that it must contain
 *  no more than MAXINT elements. If this is too small, write your own
 *  allocator.
 *
 *  Even More Details
 *
 *  If you specify an element size that is not a nice multiple of your machine
 *  word length, you are *very* likely to get data alignment (bus) errors.
 *  E.g., if your element is not a convenient multiple of
 *  sizeof(double) in size, double data are likely to die.
 *
 *  The allocation scheme looks like so:
 *  [struct pool_store_header | ]
 *          __________________|
 *         |
 *         V
 *   pool  _____________________________________________________
 *         | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b |
 *         -----------------------------------------------------
 *  where each b is a pointer to an array of size 'width' of elements.
 *
 *  The size characteristics of this scheme are tunable at run time so that
 *  it can be scaled well when the number of elements and likely amount
 *  of expansion required are known.
 *
 *  When #including pool.h, make sure these files are #included first:
 *         #include <stdio.h>

/**<
 *  Creates and returns a new pool store. The returned pool_store_t
 *  contains all the necessary accounting information, but in particular
 *  the eltsize is fixed at creation. All elements requested from ps 
 *  will be pointers to eltsize bytes of memory.
 *  Returns NULL if a store of the requested length*width*eltsize
 *  cannot be initially allocated.<br><br>
 *
 *  The user may request more than length*width elements from the store:
 *  this will cause it to grow. It will grow (internally) in chunks of
 *  deltalen*width elements. The pool vector above grows in chunks of
 *  deltapool, the extra pointers in it being NULL until needed.<br><br>
 *
 *  @param length    The initial number of width*eltsize blocks that the
 *                   new pool store will contain.  If length < 1, an error
 *                   message is printed and NULL is returned.
 *
 *  @param width     Number of elements in each block.
 *                   Width should (for some architectures) be such that
 *                   width*eltsize = 2^n - 32 for some n fairly large
 *                   (heuristic: n= 9..13).  Widths that are too large may 
 *                   be prone to causing excess page faults, though the 
 *                   process cpu time reported by the clock() can be much
 *                   better for extremely large sizes.  If width < 1, an
 *                   error message is printed and NULL is returned.<br><br>
 *                   Widths that are too small will result in an excessive
 *                   number of pool expansions, which may severely limit
 *                   performance on some VM systems.  See deltapool below
 *                   about pool expansions.<br><br>
 *                   If you know something about the page size of your
 *                   architecture, fiddling with width may help you reduce 
 *                   your page fault or cache miss count in some uses.
 *
 *  @param eltsize   Element size maintained by the pool.
 *                   For maximum efficiency, eltsize should be an integer
 *                   multiple of sizeof(void *). If it is not, elts will be
 *                   padded so that this is the case. This is to avoid
 *                   pointer data misalignment.  This restriction may or
 *                   may not help avoid alignment problems with items inside
 *                   the user's element structure.
 *
 *  @param deltalen  Number of additional pointers in the pool that will be
 *                   allocated when more elements are needed than are
 *                   available internally.  deltalen must be at least 1 or
 *                   creation of the new pool will fail.
 *
 *  @param deltapool Size change of the pool array when expanded.  It should
 *                   be as large as you are willing to tolerate.  The pool 
 *                   array starts out completely filled (all pointers allocated). 
 *                   When the pool needs more pointers it gets them in chunks of 
 *                   at least deltapool.  These additional pointers will not 
 *                   automatically have elements allocated to them; rather,
 *                   they will be initialized to NULL and filled in only as the 
 *                   chunks of deltalen*width elements are required.
