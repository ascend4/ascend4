/**
	@file
	Time module

	Provide a function to monitor elapsed time during the
	course of execution of a program and standard ANSI
	primitives for performing calendar calculations.

	@TODO (Apology) We apologize for the existence of this file and for
	its name being the same as an ANSI C header which is not
	consistently available, unfortunately. We really
	ought not to need this header.

	06/90 - original version
	08/93 - removed CLOCKS_PER_SECOND which should be
			provided by the standard library, eliminated
			tm_TPS and changed tm_run_time() and
			tm_cpu_time() to return number of seconds
	06/94 - eliminated cute calendar functions for full
			ANSI compatibility.
