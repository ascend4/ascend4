*//** @file
	Interface to Karl Westerberg's Solver.

	@DEPRECATED This header file relates to a disused command-line based interface
	for the ASCEND system. It might still be possible to do something useful
	with this though, so it has been kept for now -- JP, Feb 2011.

	@todo Clean junk out of solver/slv_interface.h.
