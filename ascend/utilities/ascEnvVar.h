	Ascend Environment Variable Imitation.

	This file exists because win32, among others, aren't POSIX
	compliant. In particular, getting and setting environment vars
	is exceedingly unreliable.  This file implements a general way
	to store and fetch multiple paths.

	Requires:
	#include "utilities/ascConfig.h"

	Linking against this header requires linking optionally
	(depending on defines in list.h and the makefile):
	    - ascmalloc.o,
	    - pool.o,
	and definitely
	    - list.o
	    - ascPanic.o
	    - ascEnvVar.o
