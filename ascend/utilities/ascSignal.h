	Signal handling protocol definitions for ASCEND.

	This file standardizes the handling of signals because some OS
	reset signals to SIG_DFL when a trap goes off while others
	process the signal but leave the trapping function in place.
	We want the second behavior and this gives it to us.

	This module implements limited support for managing signal handlers.
	This includes:
	  - a standard signal handler - Asc_SignalTrap()
	  - global jmp_buf's for use with Asc_SignalTrap()
	  - functions for managing nested signal handlers
	
	The following signal types are currently supported:
	  - SIGFPE  - floating point exception
	  - SIGINT  - CTRL-C interactive attention request
	  - SIGSEGV - segmentation fault
	
	A simple use of these facilities to trap floating point exceptions
	might be as follows:
	<pre>
	   Asc_SignalInit();
	   Asc_SignalHandlerPush(SIGFPE, Asc_SignalTrap);
	   if (setjmp(g_fpe_env)==0) {
	     y = sqrt(x);
	   } else {
	     y = sqrt(-x);
	   }
	   Asc_SignHandlerPop(SIGFPE,Asc_SignalTrap);
	   Asc_SignalDestroy();
	</pre>

	This example uses the built-in signal handler Asc_SignalTrap()
	and the global <code>jmp_buf</code> g_fpe_env.  After initializing
	the signal manager and registering the handler, <code>setjmp</code>
	is used to select normal and exception paths.  The <code>setjmp</code>
	returns 0 when initially called and the sqrt(x) is calculated.  If
	x is negative, a SIGFPE exception occurs and the handler is called.  It
	uses <code>lngjmp</code> and returns to the if statement, and now
	'setjmp' returns non-zero and the <code>else</code> clause is executed.
	Finally, the handler is removed and the signal manager cleaned up.<br><br>
	
	The stack mechanism also allows nested handlers to be registered.  It is
	important to note that nested handlers for the same signal type cannot
	both use Asc_SignalTrap() as the handler.  This is because different
	<code>jmp_buf</code> variables must be used and Asc_SignalTrap() uses
	the same global <code>jmp_buf</code> each time.  However, you can use
	custome <code>jmp_buf</code>'s and handlers:

	<pre>
	   Asc_SignalInit();
	   Asc_SignalHandlerPush(SIGFPE, Asc_SignalTrap);
	   if (setjmp(g_fpe_env) == 0) {
	       y = sqrt(x);
	       Asc_SignalHandlerPush(SIGFPE, my_handler);
	       if (setjmp(my_jmp_buf) == 0) {
	           y = z/x;
	       } else {
	           Asc_Panic(1, NULL, "Div by zero error.");
	       }
	       Asc_SignHandlerPop(SIGFPE, my_handler);
	   } else {
	     y = sqrt(-x);
	   }
	   Asc_SignHandlerPop(SIGFPE,Asc_SignalTrap);
	   Asc_SignalDestroy();
	</pre>
	
	Here, exceptions in the sqrt(x) calculation are handled by the standard
	Asc_SignalTrap(), while the division is handled by my_handler.<br><br>
	
	Avoid mixing use of the signal manager with direct calls to signal().
	Once Asc_SignalInit() has been called, use of signal() directly is likely
	to be lost or to corrupt the managed handlers.<br><br>
	
	Another warning: setjmp is expensive if called inside a fast loop.

 *  Because the jmp_buf is global, so you can't nest calls to
 *  setjmp where both use this trap function.<br><br>

 *  you want it reinstalled after an exception, be sure to call this
 *  function after the longjmp return.  This call is not particularly
 *  cheap if it does the reinstallation.<br><br>
 *
 *  This module tests on startup for whether the OS reverts to
