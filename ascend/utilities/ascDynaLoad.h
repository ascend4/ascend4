	ChangeLog
	Added Asc_DynamicUnLoad. Ben Allan (ballan@cs.cmu.edu) Jan 1998.
	Your mileage may vary.
	UnLoad alleged for sun, hp, sgi, and alpha/osf. It probably works
	only as well as their dlclose and shl_unload do.
	Split Asc_DynamicSymbol() into Asc_DynamicVariable() and
	Asc_DynamicFunction() so callers don't have to cast between
	data and function pointers (forbidden by ISO C).  JDS Dec 2005

 *  return 1, or you won't be able to tell whether the library was
 *  successfully loaded or not.  If it's under your control, have
 *  initFunc only return values other than 1 so you can detect the
