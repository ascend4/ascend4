	<b>In the case of ASCEND, a SlvBackendToken is simply a pointer to an
	Instance structure.</b>

	Since we want the Slv interface to appear totally backend
	independent (in particular because it is convenient), we
	define our interface in terms of SlvBackendTokens.
	Any backend can be connected by an appropriate set of
	routines conforming to the headers of slv_*, rel.h, var.h
	and system.h.
	
	We haven't yet been able to think through the possibilities of
	having multiple backends operating _simultaneously_, mainly
	because the ASCEND backend is quite capable of wrapping all
	the other backends we can think of.
