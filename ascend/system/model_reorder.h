	Model-based Reordering Routines

	These functions are part of a new design for feeding
	solvers from the ASCEND compiler.

	File to play MODEL-relation-based reordering games.
	We're starting with a basic RBBD implementation

	Assumptions:
	- If the MODELs are hierarchical, then they have been indexed in a
	  tree bottom-up fashion.
	- Input is a square block that needs tearing and not a rectangle.
