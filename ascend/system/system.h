*//** @file
	System routines for the SLV solver.

	This is the ASCEND version of the system module.
	This provides a means of extracting a solver system
	from an ASCEND instance tree.

	The result is supposed to appear totally instance
	independent, though it is not really, so that
	only the var and rel modules need to know about
	the ascend compiler.

	With any luck the expr, exprman, and relman files leave.
