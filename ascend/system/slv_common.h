	SLV common utilities & structures for ASCEND solvers.

	Routines in this header are applicable to both the system API (as accessed
	from ASCEND compiler and GUI/CLI) as well as the solver backend (slv3.c,
	and other solvers, etc)

	This header therefore includes the following:
	  - parameters struct definitions & manipulation routines
	  - status struct definitions & retrieval routines
	  - vector operations
	  - solver print routines
	  - lnkmap support functions

	@see slv_client.h for the routines that a concrete SLV solver will use to access the model.
	@see slv_server.h for the routines that ASCEND uses to run and query the solver.

	@NOTE
	USAGE NOTES:
	slv.h is the header for folks on the ASCEND end, and this is the one for
	folks on the Slv math end.
	Don't protoize this file for ASCEND types other than mtx, vec, and boolean
	real64, and int32 or we'll have you shot. In particular, not var and rel.
	People who aren't supposed to know about var and rel include this.

	In particular, this header may be used without knowing about the ASCEND
	compiler or any of its annoying insanities so long as you drag out
	ascmalloc().
	This does commit you to being able to stomach the mtx.h file, however,
	even if you choose to ignore the contents of mtx.

	Several functions, notably the print suite for rel/var names,
	assume you are linking against something that does know about
	ASCEND instances unless you have #defined SLV_STANDALONE

	The parameters and status struct definitions have been moved here,
	being of general interest.
	@ENDNOTE
*//*
 	Abstracted from
	slvX.c January 1995. Based on the original slv.h by KW and JZ (01/94), by Ben Allan.

/**
 *  Solver status flags.
 *  <pre>
 *  The following is a list of statuses and their meanings.  Statuses
 *  cannot be written to, and thus there is no notion of default value.
 *
 *  ok:
 *     Specifies whether or not everything is "ok".  It is a shorthand for
 *     testing all of the other flags.
 *
 *  over_defined:
 *  under_defined:
 *  struct_singular:
 *     Specifies whether the system is over-defined, under-defined, or
 *     structurally singular.  These fields are set by slv_presolve where
 *     the structural analysis is performed.  It should be noted that
 *     over_defined and under_defined are mutually exclusive and both
 *     imply struct_singular, although a system can be structurally
 *     singular without being over-defined or under-defined.
 *
 *  ready_to_solve:
 *     Specifies whether the system is ready to solve.  In other words, is
 *     slv_iterate or slv_solve legal?  This flag is FALSE before
 *     slv_presolve or after the system has converged or the solver has
 *     given up for whatever reason.
 *
 *  converged:
 *     This flag is set whenever the entire system has converged.  The
 *     convergence will be genuine (all relations satisfied within
 *     tolerance, all bounds satisfied, all calculations defined, etc.).
 *
 *  diverged:
 *     This flag is set whenever the solver has truly given up (i.e. given
 *     up for any reason not covered below).
 *
 *  inconsistent:
 *     The solver has concluded unambiguously (e.g. by symbolic
 *     manipulation) that the system is inconsistent.
 *
 *  calc_ok:
 *     Specifies whether or not there were any calculation errors in
 *     computing the residuals at the current point.
 *
 *  iteration_limit_exceeded:
 *     Specifies whether or not the iteration count was exceeded or not.
 *
 *  time_limit_exceeded:
 *     Specifies whether or not the cpu time limit was exceeded.
 *
 *  panic:
 *     Specifies whether or not the user called a halt interactively;
 *
 *  iteration:
 *     Total number of iterations so far.  Total iteration count is reset to
 *     zero whenever slv_presolve or slv_resolve is called.
 *
 *  cpu_elapsed:
 *     Total number of cpu seconds elapsed.  Total cpu time elapsed is reset
 *     to zero whenever slv_presolve or slv_resolve is called.
 *
 *  block.number_of:
 *     Number of blocks in system.
 *
 *  block.current_block:
 *     Block number of the current block that the solver is working on.
 *     It is assumed that all previous blocks have already converged.
 *
 *  block.current_size:
 *     Number of variables/relations in the current block.
 *
 *  block.previous_total_size:
 *     Total size of previous blocks (= number of variables/relations
 *     already converged).
 *
 *  block.iteration:
 *     Number of iterations so far in the current block.
 *
 *  block.functime:
 *     Number of cpu seconds elapsed getting residuals from whereever.
 *
 *  block.jactime:
 *     Number of cpu seconds elapsed getting jacobians from whereever.
 *
 *  block.cpu_elapsed:
 *     Number of cpu seconds elapsed so far in the current block.
 *
 *  block.residual:
 *     Current residual (RMS value) for the current block.
 *
 *  cost (READ ONLY)
 *    This is a pointer to first of an array which is costsize long of
 *    slv_block_cost structures. This is to collect data for the
 *    comparison of algorithms. All solvers should have at least
 *    one of these, though the interface will check for null before
 *    reading the data. The block_cost structure contains:
 *      size       (how big is the block, in terms of variables)
 *      iterations (how many iterations to convergence/divergence)
 *      funcs      (how many function evaluations were made?)
 *      jacs       (how many jacobian evaluations were made?)
 *      time       (how much cpu total time elapsed while in the block?)
 *      functime   (time spent in function evaluations)
 *      jactime    (time spent in jacobian evaluations, stuffing)
 *                 (for those codes where a function evaluation is
 *                  a byproduct of gradient evaluation, the func cost
 *                  will be billed here.)
 *    The interpretation of these data is somewhat up to the coder.
 *
 *  costsize
 *    This is how big the cost array is. It should in general be the
 *    number of blocks in the system plus 1 so that all the unincluded
 *    relations can be billed to the blocks+1th cost if they are
 *    evaluated.

 *  Builds a row-biased mapping array from the hi,hj lists given.
 *  The map returned has the following format:
 *    - map[i] is a vector describing the incidence in row i of the matrix.
 *    - Let vars=map[i], where vars is int32 *.
 *    - vars[0]=number of incidences in the relation.
 *    - For all 0<=k<vars[0]
 *       - vars[2*k+1] = original column index of some var in the eqn.
 *       - vars[2*k+2] = the lnk list index of element(i,vars[2*k+1])
 *
 *  The ordering of column data (i.e. vars[2*k+1]) is implementation-defined
 *  and should not be counted on.  Similarly, the lnk list index (i.e.
 *  vars[2*k+2]) will be a unique number in the range (0..hl-1), but the
 *  exact ordering is implementation-defined.  The map should only be
 *  deallocated by destroy_lnkmap().  The memory allocation for a lnkmap
 *  is done efficiently.<br><br>
 *
 *  These create an odd compressed row mapping, given the hi and hj
 *  subscript vectors.  The primary utility of the lnkmap is that
 *  it can be traversed rapidly when one wants to conditionally map a row of
 *  a Harwell style (arbitrarily ordered) link representation
 *  back into another representation where adding elements to a row
 *  is easily done.<br><br>
 *
 *  hi and hj should specify a unique incidence pattern.  That is, duplicate
 *  (hi, hj) coordinates are not allowed and only 1 of the occurrences will
 *  end up in the map.  hi should contain row indexes all less than m.
 *  hj should contain column indexes all less than n.  If an invalid row/col
 *  index is encountered, NULL is returned.
 *
 *  @param m  The number of rows expected (> highest index in hi).
 *            The map returned will be this long.
 *  @param n  The number of columns expected (> highest index in hj).
 *  @param hl The length of hi and hj.
 *  @param hi The eqn indices of a C numbered sparse matrix list.
 *  @param hj The var indices of a C numbered sparse matrix list.
 *  @return Pointer to the new lnkmap array, or NULL if an error occurred.
