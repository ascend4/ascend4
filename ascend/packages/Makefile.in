#  ASCEND external packages makefile

#  August 26, 1994

# This file builds the objects from external sources. The
# ascend interfaces to these objects are currently built
# in the compiler, though they should probably be built here
# as well. Since that is the case, this file assumes libpackages.a
# exists in ../archive and adds the external objects to it.
# This means this directory should be remade anytime libpackages.a
# is remade via the compiler.
#
# Eventually this should also be the home to the BLAS files that
# are common to minos, lsode, etc.
