To install MINOS on Cray or Convex systems, or machines for which
single-precision arithmetic is adequate, proceed as follows.

 1. Check that the Fortran source code has been converted to single precision.
    If necessary,

       change "double precision" to "real            "
       change "integer*4"        to "integer  "
       change "dasum"            to "sasum"
       change "daxpy"            to "saxpy"
       change "dcopy"            to "scopy"
       change "ddot"             to "sdot"
       change "dnrm2"            to "snrm2"
       change "dscal"            to "sscal"
       change "idamax"           to "isamax"
       change "d+"               to "e+"
       change "d-"               to "e-"

 2. In subroutine m1init, set
       eps    = 1.0e-15   (roughly)
       nwordr = 1
       nwordi = 1
       nwordh = 1

 3. In subroutine m3hash in file mi35inpt (previously m1hash in mi10mach)
    change two sets of four lines, as described in the in-line comments.

 4. Follow the general guidelines in m1minos.doc.
