*     ------------------------------------------------------------------
*     minoss (pronounced minos-s) is the subroutine version of MINOS.
*     It has all the data passed to it as parameters instead of reading
*     it from an MPS file.
*
*     ON ENTRY:
*
*     start   specifies how a starting basis (and certain other items)
*             are to be obtained.
*             start = 'Cold' means that Crash should be used to choose
*                      an initial basis, unless a basis file is given
*                      via Old basis, Insert or Load in the Specs file.
*             start = 'Basis file' means the same (but is more
*                      meaningful in the latter case).
*             start = 'Warm' means that a basis is already defined in hs
*                      (probably from an earlier call).
*             start = 'Hot' or 'Hot FHS' implies a hot start.
*                      hs defines a basis and an earlier call has
*                      defined certain other things that should also be
*                      kept.  The problem dimensions and the array z(*)
*                      must not have changed.
*                      F refers to the LU factors of the basis.
*                      H refers to the approximate reduced Hessian R.
*                      S refers to column and row scales.
*             start = 'Hot H' (for example) means that only the Hessian
*                      is defined.
*
*     m       is the number of general constraints.  For LP problems
*             this means the number of rows in the constraint matrix A.
*             m > 0 in principle, though sometimes m = 0 may be ok.
*             (Strictly speaking, Fortran declarations of the form
*                double precision   pi(m)
*             require m > 0.  In debug mode, compilers will probably
*             enforce m > 0, but optimized code may run ok with m = 0.)
*
*     n       is the number of variables, excluding slacks.
*             For LP problems, this is the number of columns in A.
*             n > 0.
*
*     nb      is n + m.
*
*     ne      is the number of nonzero entries in A (including the
*             Jacobian for any nonlinear constraints).
*             ne > 0 in principle, though again m = 0, ne = 0 may work
*             with some compilers.
*
*     nname   is the number of column and row names provided in the
*             arrays name1 and name2.  If nname = 1, there are NO names.
*             Generic names will be used in the printed solution.
*             Otherwise, nname = nb and all names must be provided.
*
*     nncon   is the number of nonlinear constraints.
*             nncon ge 0.
*
*     nnobj   is the number of nonlinear objective variables.
*             nnobj ge 0.
*
*     nnjac   is the number of nonlinear Jacobian variables.
*             If nncon = 0, nnjac = 0.
*             If nncon > 0, nnjac > 0.
*
*     iobj    says which row of A is a free row containing a linear
*             objective vector  c  (iobj = 0 if none).
*             iobj = 0  or  nncon < iobj le m.
*
*     objadd  is a constant that will be added to the objective.
*             Typically objadd = 0.0d+0.
*
*     names(5)is a set of 8-character names for the problem, the linear
*             objective, the rhs, the ranges and bounds.  (This is a
*             hangover from MPS files.  The names are used in the
*             printed solution and in some of the basis files.)
*
*     a(ne)   is the constraint matrix (Jacobian), stored column-wise.
*
*     ha(ne)  is the list of row indices for each nonzero in a(*).
*
*     ka(n+1) is a set of pointers to the beginning of each column of
*             the constraint matrix within a(*) and ha(*).
*             Must have ka(1) = 1 and ka(n+1) = ne+1.
*
*  NOTES:  1. If the problem has a nonlinear objective,
*             the first nnobj columns of a and ha belong to the
*             nonlinear objective variables.
*             Subroutine funobj deals with these variables.
*          
*          2. If the problem has nonlinear constraints,
*             the first nnjac columns of a and ha belong to the
*             nonlinear Jacobian variables, and
*             the first nncon rows of a and ha belong to the
*             nonlinear constraints.
*             Subroutine funcon deals with these variables and
*             constraints.
*          
*          3. If nnobj > 0 and nnjac > 0, the two sets of
*             nonlinear variables overlap.  The total number of
*             nonlinear variables is nn = max( nnobj, nnjac ).
*          
*          4. The Jacobian forms the top left corner of a and ha.
*             If a Jacobian column j (1 le j le nnjac) contains
*             any entries a(k), ha(k) associated with nonlinear
*             constraints (1 le ha(k) le nncon), those entries must
*             come before any other (linear) entries.
*          
*          5. The row indices ha(k) for a column may be in any order
*             (subject to Jacobian entries appearing first).
*             Subroutine funcon must define Jacobian entries in the
*             same order.
*          
*          6. If column j contains no entries, perhaps
*             ka(j) = ka(j+1) is acceptable.  (Must check this.
*             When MINOS reads an MPS with empty columns,
*             it inserts a dummy entry a(k) = 0.0d+0, ha(k) = 1.
*             This may not be necessary.)
*
*          7. To allocate storage, MINOS needs to know if the Jacobian
*             is dense or sparse.  The default is dense.  If this is
*             not appropriate, define
*                              Jacobian    Sparse
*             in the Specs file, or
*                call miopt ( 'Jacobian    Sparse', 0, 0, inform )
*             before calling minoss.
*                
*     bl(nb)  is the lower bounds on the variables and slacks (x, s).
*
*     bu(nb)  is the upper bounds on (x, s).
*
*     BEWARE: MINOS represents general constraints as Ax + s = 0.
*             Constraints of the form   l <= Ax <= u  
*             therefore mean            l <= -s <= u,
*             so that                  -u <=  s <= -l.
*             The last m components of bl and bu are -u and -l.
*
*     name1(nname), name2(nname) are two integer arrays.
*             If nname =  1, name1 and name2 are not used.  The printed
*             solution will use generic names for the columns and rows.
*             If nname = nb, name1(j) and name2(j) should contain the
*             name of the j-th variable in 2a4 format (j = 1, nb).
*             If j = n+i, the j-th variable is the i-th row.
*
*     hs(nb)  sometimes contains a set of initial states for each
*             variable x, or for each variable and slack (x, s).
*             See the following NOTES.
*
*     xn(nb)  sometimes contains a set of initial values for each
*             variable x, or for each variable and slack (x, s).
*             See the following NOTES.
*
*  NOTES:  1. If start = 'Cold' or 'Basis file' and a basis file
*             of some sort is to be input
*             (an OLD BASIS file, INSERT file or LOAD file),
*             hs and xn need not be set at all.
*
*          2. Otherwise, hs(j) and xn(j), j=1:n, must be defined for a
*             Cold start.  (The values for j=n+1:nb need not be set.)
*             If nothing special is known about the problem, or if
*             there is no wish to provide special information,
*             you may set hs(j) = 0, xn(j) = 0.0d+0 for all j=1:n.
*             All variables will be eligible for the initial basis.
*        
*             Less trivially, to say that variable j will probably
*             be equal to one of its bounds,
*             set hs(j) = 4 and xn(j) = bl(j)
*             or  hs(j) = 5 and xn(j) = bu(j) as appropriate.
*        
*          3. For Cold starts with no basis file, a Crash procedure
*             is used to select an initial basis.  The initial basis
*             matrix will be triangular (ignoring certain small
*             entries in each column).
*             The values hs(j) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 have the following
*             meaning:
*                
*             hs(j)    State of variable j during Crash
*        
*             0, 1, 3  Eligible for the basis.  3 is given preference.
*             2, 4, 5  Ignored.
*        
*             After Crash, columns for which hs(j) = 2 are made superbasic.
*             Other columns not selected for the basis are made
*             nonbasic at the value xn(j) if bl(j) <= xn(j) <= bu(j),
*             or at the value bl(j) or bu(j) closest to xn(j).
*
*          4. For Warm or Hot starts, all of hs(1:nb) is assumed to be
*             set to the values 0, 1, 2 or 3 (probably from some
*             previous call) and all of xn(1:nb) must have values.
*        
*     pi(m)   contains an estimate of the vector of Lagrange multipliers
*             (shadow prices) for the NONLINEAR constraints.  The first
*             nncon components must be defined.  They will be used as
*             lambda in the subproblem objective function for the first
*             major iteration.  If nothing is known about lambda,
*             set pi(i) = 0.0d+0, i = 1 to nncon.
*
*     ns      need not be specified for Cold starts,
*             but should retain its value from a previous call
*             when a Warm or Hot start is used.
*
*
*     ON EXIT:
*
*     hs(nb)  is the final state vector:
*
*                hs(j)    State of variable j    Normal value of xn(j)
*
*                  0      nonbasic               bl(j)
*                  1      nonbasic               bu(j)
*                  2      superbasic             Between bl(j) and bu(j)
*                  3      basic                  ditto
*
*             Very occasionally there may be nonbasic variables for
*             which xn(j) lies strictly between its bounds.
*             If ninf = 0, basic and superbasic variables may be outside
*             their bounds by as much as the Feasibility tolerance.
*             Note that if Scale is specified, the Feasibility tolerance
*             applies to the variables of the SCALED problem. 
*             In this case, the variables of the original problem may be
*             as much as 0.1 outside their bounds, but this is unlikely
*             unless the problem is very badly scaled.
*
*     xn(nb)  is the final variables and slacks (x, s).
*
*     pi(m)   is the vector of Lagrange multipliers (shadow prices)
*             for the general constraints.
*
*     rc(nb)  is a vector of reduced costs: rc = g - (A I)'pi, where g
*             is the gradient of the objective function if xn is feasible
*             (or the gradient of the Phase-1 objective otherwise).
*             If ninf = 0, the last m entries are -pi (negative pi).
*
*     inform  says what happened; see Chapter 6.3 of the User's Guide.
*             A summary of possible values follows:
*
*             inform   Meaning
*
*                0     Optimal solution found.
*                1     The problem is infeasible.
*                2     The problem is unbounded (or badly scaled).
*                3     Too many iterations.
*                4     Apparent stall.  The solution has not changed
*                      for a large number of iterations (e.g. 1000).
*                5     The Superbasics limit is too small.
*                6     Subroutine funobj or funcon requested termination
*                      by returning mode < 0.
*                7     Subroutine funobj seems to be giving incorrect
*                      gradients.
*                8     Subroutine funcon seems to be giving incorrect
*                      gradients.
*                9     The current point cannot be improved.
*               10     Numerical error in trying to satisfy the linear
*                      constraints (or the linearized nonlinear
*                      constraints).  The basis is very ill-conditioned.
*               11     Cannot find a superbasic to replace a basic
*                      variable.
*               12     Basis factorization requested twice in a row.
*                      Should probably be treated as inform = 9.
*               13     Near-optimal solution found.
*                      Should probably be treated as inform = 9.
*
*               20     Not enough storage for the basis factorization.
*               21     Error in basis package.
*               22     The basis is singular after several attempts to
*                      factorize it (and add slacks where necessary).
*
*               30     An OLD BASIS file had dimensions that did not
*                      match the current problem.
*               32     System error.  Wrong number of basic variables.
*
*               40     Fatal errors in the MPS file.
*               41     Not enough storage to read the MPS file.
*               42     Not enough storage to solve the problem.
*
*     mincor  says how much storage is needed to solve the problem.
*             If inform = 42, the work array z(nwcore) was too small.
*             minoss may be called again with nwcore suitably larger
*             than mincor.  (The bigger the better, since it is
*             not certain how much storage the basis factors need.)
*
*     ns      is the final number of superbasics.
*
*     ninf    is the number of infeasibilities.
*
*     sinf    is the sum    of infeasibilities.
*
*     obj     is the value  of the objective function.
*             If ninf = 0, obj includes the nonlinear objective if any.
*             If ninf > 0, obj is just the linear objective if any.

      double precision   z(nwcore)

*     ------------------------------------------------------------------
*     minos2 asks minos3 to solve the problem just found in the SPECS
*     file.  For standard Fortran installations, that is all.
*
*     For some installations, this is an appropriate place to
*     increase the size of the workspace array  z,  to allow
*     solution of arbitrarily large problems without recompiling
*     the main program, in which z(nwcore) is originally declared.
*
*     z  might have to be in blank common if it is to be expanded.
*     The default size  nwcore  should be large enough to solve
*     reasonably big problems without change (e.g., nwcore = 100000).
*
*     At this stage, the SPECS file has been read and values are known
*     for maxw, maxz and mincor.  The default values for the first two
*     are maxw = 0 and maxz = nwcore, but we allow the user to alter
*     these by means of two cards in the SPECS file of the following
*     form...
*
*        Workspace (user)      10000 words  (This sets  maxw = 10000)
*        Workspace (total)     90000 words  (This sets  maxz = 90000)
*
*     MINOS will use only  Z(maxw+1), ..., Z(maxz).  Hence,
*     z(1), ..., z(maxw)    and possibly   z(maxz+1), ..., z(nwcore)
*     may be used as workspace by the user during solution of this
*     particular problem (e.g., within funobj or funcon).
*
*     If maxz is set to a value less than nwcore, it may serve to
*     reduce paging activity on a machine with virtual memory, by
*     confining MINOS (in particular the basis-factorization routines)
*     to an area of core that is sensible for the current problem.
*     On some systems (e.g., Burroughs), this will allow z(nwcore)
*     to be declared arbitrarily large at compile time.
*
*     mincor contains an estimate of the minimum core requirements,
*     allowing for maxw but ignoring maxz.  z is already large enough
*     if nwcore .ge. max( maxz, mincor ).  Systems that allow z to be
*     re-allocated at run-time should make appropriate use of the
*     logical variable enough.

*
*     01 Oct 1991: minoss, mispec and misolv implemented.
*                  minos1, minos2, minos3 reorganized

*     20 Apr 1992: Parameter list revised.  nname, name1, name2 added.
*     27 Jun 1992: Cold, Warm, Hot start implemented.
*     09 Jul 1992: ns initialized here only for Cold starts, just to

*                             CYCLE  PROCEDURE
*
*     The following notes are relevant if Cycle limit = 2 or more.
*
*  1. Scaling and/or Crash are controlled on each cycle by the following
*     logical variables:
*
*     If gotscl is true, scales are retained from the previous cycle.
*                        Otherwise, scales are recomputed (if lscale>0).
*
*     If gotbas is true, the basis is retained.  Otherwise, Crash is
*                        called.
*
*
*  2. When m5solv is called, Flying Starts are controlled by the
*     following logical variables:
*
*     If gotfac is true, an LU factorization of the basis is assumed
*                        to be present.  (Ignored if there are any
*                        nonlinear constraints.)
*
*     If gothes is true, z(lr) is assumed to contain a useful
*                        reduced-Hessian approximation.
*
*
*  3. For the next cycle,
*        m4getb sets gotscl and gotbas to be true, and
*        m5solv sets gotfac and gothes to current values (usually true).
*     These values will often be appropriate.  However, the expert user
*     of matmod must set some or all of the logical variables to .false.
*     if the problem data or state have been significantly altered.
*
*     For example, if the Jacobian was used by the scaling routine
*     (Scale option 2) and if the Jacobian could be rather different
*     from its value at the start of the previous cycle, it may be
*     advisable to request new scales by setting gotscl = .false.
*
*     Similarly, if matmod alters some matrix elements in columns that
*     are currently basic, one should set gotfac = .false. to force
*     refactorization.  In particular, if the linear objective row c is
*     altered, gotfac should be set to .false., since c is part of the
*     LU factors.

*     'IN ' refers to an existing input file that will not be altered.

*     exists, it might be OK to overwrite it, but on some systems it
*     is better to create a new version of the file.  The choice is
*     open (to coin a phrase).

*     15 Jul 1989: First version, follows some of the advice offered

*---     rewind( lun, err=900 )

*     written for DEC VAX/VMS systems by Irvin Lustig,
*     Department of Operations Research, Stanford University, 1987.
*
*     MINOS  calls m1time only.  m1time calls m1cpu  and  m1timp.
*     Only m1cpu is intrinsically machine dependent.
*
*     If a timer is available, call it in m1cpu  and arrange that
*     m1cpu  returns the current CPU time in seconds.
*
*     If a timer is not available or not wanted, set time = 0.0 in m1cpu.
*     Timing will be turned off and m1timp will not be called.
*     ------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*     m1time turns on or off a selected clock and optionally prints
*     statistics regarding all clocks or just the clock chosen.
*
*     The value of abs(clock) is which clock to use.
*     If clock = 0 and prtopt = 0, all clocks and statistics are reset.
*     If clock > 0, the clock is reset to start timing at the
*                   current time (determined by calling the
*                   machine-dependent subroutine m1cpu).
*     If clock < 0, the clock is turned off and the statistic is
*                   recorded for the amount of time since the clock
*                   was turned on.
*
*     prtopt is the print option.
*     If ltime < 0, nothing is printed.  Otherwise,
*     prtopt = 0 indicates print nothing,
*            = 1 indicates print last time for this clock,
*                only if clock < 0 (it has just been turned off),
*            = 2 indicates print total time for all clocks,
*            = 3 indicates print mean  time for all clocks.
*
*     The procedure for adding a new timer n is as follows:
*     1)  Change ntime to n in the parameter statement below (and in
*         all other routines referencing common block /m1tim /).
*     2)  Expand the array "label" to length n in subroutine m1timp.
*
*     04 Jun 1989: Irv's VMS/VAXC version of m1cpu installed,
*                  with changes to return time in seconds.
*     10 Jul 1992: More clocks added for use in AMPL (and elsewhere).

*     ------------------------------------------------------------------
*     m1cpu is a machine-dependent routine to return time = cpu time
*     in seconds, so that 2 consecutive calls will indicate the
*     time difference of operations between the 2 calls.
*     The parameter 'mode' indicates what function should be done
*     to the timer.  This allows necessary initialization for certain
*     machines.
*     mode =  1  indicates initialization,
*     mode =  0  indicates normal use,
*     mode = -1  indicates stop the timer.
*
*     For the MicroVax II under VMS, we need to call the correct library
*     routine to get the timer statistics.  These statistics are
*     found by using the times() function in the VaX C Runtime library.
*     To use this version of m1cpu, one must create an options file
*     called  vmsc.opt  with the line
*        SYS$LIBRARY:VAXCRTL/SHARE
*     in it.   Then link using the usual command and append   ,vmsc/opt
*     to the end of the line.  The name vmsc can be anything you desire.
