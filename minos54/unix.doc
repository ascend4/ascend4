This is file Unix.doc.
To install MINOS on a typical Unix system, proceed as follows.

 1. Transfer all files from the MINOS floppy disk to a MINOS
    directory of your choice.

 2. Files beginning with "v" are for DEC VAX/VMS systems and can be deleted:
       ls v*
       rm v*
       rm mi10vms.for

 3. Change some file names:
       mv unix.mak makefile
       mv unix.nam fortnames
       mv unix.run run

 4. Make two scripts executable and rename *.for files to be *.f:
       chmod +x fortnames
       chmod +x run
       ls *.for
       fortnames
       ls *.f

 5. If you wish to solve only linear programs, compile and link MINOSL:
       make minosl.exe

    Otherwise, compile and link MINOS:
       make minos.exe

 6. Test MINOSL or MINOS on a small linear program, t1diet.
    If you are solving only linear programs,
       run                  gives you instructions.
       run minosl t1diet    runs the test.

    Otherwise,
       run                  gives you instructions.
       run minos t1diet     runs the test.

    Compare results with Section 8.1 of the MINOS 5.1 User's Guide.
    The optimal objective value is 92.5.

 7. If you chose to make minos, run some of the nonlinear 
    test problems t2... t6.  In particular,
      run minos t2banana    runs an unconstrained example      (Section 8.1)
      run minos t3qp        runs a small quadratic program     (Section 8.2)
      run minos t4manne     runs problem MANNE                 (Section 8.4)
      run minos t5weapon    runs the Weapon Assignment problem (Section 7.6)

    For t4manne, the iteration log will be different from that shown
    in Section 8.4, but the optimal objective value should be the same,
    close to 2.670.

 8. Solution of larger problems may require more storage than that
    declared in the main program (file mi00main.f).  If necessary,
    increase the parameter "nwcore".  For problems with m general constraints,
    a rough estimate is     nwcore = 100m.

 9. Solution of further nonlinear problems requires user-specific code
    (subroutines funobj and/or funcon).

10. If MINOS is to be used as a subroutine, a calling program is needed
    to set up the data and call subroutine minoss (pronounced minos-s).
    File minoss.for contains an example that generates the problem t4manne.
    To run this:
       make minoss.exe    compiles minoss.f and makes minoss.exe
       run minoss         runs minoss.exe to solve t4manne.
