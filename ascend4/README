(Which really means that if you take it, find bugs and are cordial, we
will be happy to work with you on fixing it, but our research comes

   ASCEND is distributed without warranty.  See the file `COPYING' in

Unpacking ASCEND
================

   Building and using ASCEND requires release 8.0p2 of the Tcl language
and Tk Toolkit, and release 1.8 or newer of the TkTable add-on, as well
as the ASCEND sources.  We realize these pieces make it a bit more
difficult for you to get a complete distribution, so we will explain how
to download and unpack ASCEND to make sure you get all of the pieces.

  1. The first piece is the C and Tcl source code for the ASCEND binary
     (compiler, solver, interface, etc) itself.  You'll find this in the
     file ascendiv-0.9.tar.Z.

  2. If you do not have Tcl/Tk at your site, or you have a version prior
     to Tcl/Tk 8.0p2, you will need to download tcl8.0p2.tar.Z and
     tk8.0p2.tar.Z.  These file contains the language and GUI toolkit in
     which the ASCEND interface is written.

  3. If you do not have the TkTable Tk-add-on package at your site, or
     you have a version prior to TkTable 1.8, you will need to download
     tkTable1.80.tar.Z.

  4. To use the plotting capability of ASCEND, we suggest you have
     xgraph or tkxgraph.  If you do not have either of these plotting
     tools at your site, you can download a copy of either xgraph or
     tkxgraph from ASCEND's home page: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ascend/

     If you download xgraph or tkxgraph from the ASCEND site, follow the
     directions contained in those distributions.

   Once you have downloaded the files your site requires, you are ready
to unpack ASCEND.  We suggest you move the files you downloaded into
their own directory.  `cd' into that directory.

   To unpack things, issue the command:
        zcat ascendiv-0.9.tar.Z | tar xf -
and repeat for each ...tar.Z file.
