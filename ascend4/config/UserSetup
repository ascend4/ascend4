Setting up to use ASCEND:

1) For your .cshrc (.profile or whatever shell rc file you use) a handy 
alias would be:
alias ascend '$ASCENDDIST/ascend3c'

2) The environment variables needed to run ASCEND are:
setenv ASCENDDIST (the root ASCEND directory. e.g. /usr/local/ascend3)
setenv ASCENDLIBRARY $ASCENDDIST/library/examples:$ASCENDDIST/library/libraries
setenv ASCENDHELP $ASCENDDIST/help:$home
setenv ASCENDUNITS $ASCENDDIST/compiler
setenv TK_LIBRARY      /usr/local/tk/lib/tk
setenv TCL_LIBRARY     /usr/local/tk/lib/tcl
(Substitute the location of your tcl/tk directory for /usr/local if they are
not the same.)

3) Create a .ascendrc in your home directory:
cp $ASCENDDIST/TK/AscendRC ~/.ascendrc

4) Copy and modify the X resources file as suits your taste:
cp $ASCENDDIST/TK/ascend.ad ~/.ascend.ad

5) In order to refine/edit help files, you must have write permission
on $ASCENDDIST/help and its subdirectories. If security police on your
system cannot allow the users to edit ASCEND help files, then  the
edit/refine features of the help system will not work properly.
The Edit notes feature should work, however, since notes are kept in
your own directories.

6) Another optional file is .ascend-config which you can
create by clicking on Toolbox/utilities/save. Emacs users will 
want to change the Text editor selection and maybe the
Unix mail commands. ASCEND looks in ~/.ascend-config
for all it's external programs not linked by environment
variables or by being part of ASCEND itself (typer, eg).

7) To get an ascend3 commandline as well as the gui,
run ASCEND with the -c option.
