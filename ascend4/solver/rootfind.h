/*********************************************************************\
  Using Brents method, find the root of a function known to lie
  between x1 and x2. The root, returned as zbrent, will be refined
  until its accuracy is tol. The result of status must be monitored
  to see if we were successful. A nonzero code means that the result
  returned is erroneous. n is the index into the x vector of the variable
  that is to be solved for.
