 ***
 ***  Does a sparse Householder transformation to the matrix A
 ***  denoted by region, resulting in Anew.
 ***  Mathematically: Anew = (I - coef * u dot Transpose[u]) dot A.
 ***  Slightly faster in the case of coef = 1.0.
 ***  Returns immediately in the case of coef = 0.0.
 ***  Note following unusual assumptions, however:
 ***  1)The user has already cleared out the leading column in the
 ***    region and we will not be doing anything to it. This is usually
 ***    the case since that column is where u was derived from.
 ***  2)The sparse, sp, supplied by the user contains the nonzero
 ***    elements of u and is indexed by org row number.
 ***    Note that a soft zero in u will not hurt us: we skip it.
 ***  3)There are no elements in the regions to the left and the right
 ***    of the region.
 ***
 ***  mtx_ENTIRE_MATRIX is not a valid region for this function.
 ***
 ***  Current bugs (11/95)
 ***    ignores the transpose and droptol arguments.
 ***    does not remove soft zeroes created when 2 numbers add to zero.
