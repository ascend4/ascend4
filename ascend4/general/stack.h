/*
 *  Abstract
 *  Stacks are occasionally used in the implementation of a compiler
 *  and/or interpreter. This module (in the spirit of the list module)
 *  attempts to provide a generic stack implementation, based on a
 *  contiquous but expandable representation.
 *  It is much like gl_list, except that push and pop are defined
 *  and much of the list fanciness is eliminated.

 *  struct gs_stack_t *gs_stack_create(capacity);

 *
 *  This function takes one argument which is the anticipated size of the
 *  stack. This size simply sets the initial capacity of the stack. If the
 *  stack size exceeds the capacity, the stack is expanded. The stack will
 *  be expanded in 50% increments of the capacity when the stack would have
 *  been *overpushed.* If the stack capacity is less than 16, the capacity
 *  will be increased by at least 8 units. All mallocaters have a minimum
 *  overhead, and it makes sense to get a bigger chunk.

 *  This function accepts a stack and resets it to a clean state, as if the
 *  stack had just been created. If the stack had been automatically expanded,
 *  it will retain that stack capacity.

 *  to be destroyed(whose memory is to be returned to free memory).
 *  items is a boolean type value.  If you want the items in the stack to
 *  also be deallocated then you should set dispose to a true value, otherwise
 *  it should be false.

 *
 *  This function will push the given ptr onto the stack. It will expand
 *  the capacity of the stack if necessary. One can push any pointer onto
 *  the stack by casting appropriately.
 *
 *  Example:
 *       struct data_t *item;
 *       struct gs_stack_t = gs_create(100L);
 *       item = (struct data_t)malloc(sizeof(struct data_t));

 *       gs_stack_push(stack,(VOIDPTR)item);
 *
 *  The same would apply to the return value. See gs_stack_pop.

 *  struct gs_stack_t *stack;
 *
 *  This function will pop the top most item off the stack. The stack
 *  size will be appropriately accounted for. The return value must be
 *  appropriately cast as in the example below.
 *
 *  Example:
 *       struct data_t *item, *result;
 *       struct gs_stack_t = gs_create(100L);
 *       item = (struct data_t)malloc(sizeof(struct data_t));

 *
 *       gs_stack_push(stack,(VOIDPTR)item);
 *       result = (struct data_t*)gs_stack_pop(stack);
 *
 *  NOTE: If the stack is overpopped, i.e., the stack is empty at the time
 *  of the call of this function, NULL will be returned.

 *
 *  This function will execute the function func on all items currently on
 *  the stack. It will execute the function on the stack items from the
 *  bottom of the stack to the top. The function must be able to handle
 *  NULL pointers as input gracefully. This is potentially useful for
