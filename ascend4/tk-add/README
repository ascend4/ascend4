This is a directory for all the tk/tcl C addins we may wish to collect.
They really aren't part of the ASCEND code, so we will just collect the
lib*.a files of them here and make the interface makefile
responsible for building/linking them.

Each major extension should have its own subdirectory in the guiadd
directory.

Notes on swiped codes in this directory.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
tkTable.0.2 (C) 1994 Roland King. See his README.
Note that this is an incredibly badly structured piece of
X11 code from an includes/headers standpoint and I have
cleaned it up a bit so that gcc doesn't whine like a banshee.
He is playing the int stored in a pointer game with clientData
which is extremely noisome to any sane compiler.
