SOLVER-END-SUPPORT

Harnesses:
Support classes supplying functions that can be inherited to fit
various solver 'cores' into the ascend framework so that their
UI presentation is nice.
BasicHarness -- parameters, cca-ness, slv_system_t hooks to C.
LPHarness -- objective list/var handling.
NLPHarness -- objective list/var handling.

Interfaces:
LPSolver -- abstract functions an lp code must supply.
MonolithSolver.h -- abstract functions conopt etc must implement.
IteratingSolver.h -- abstract functions inside-out and ascend
	solvers must implement.
DAESolver.h -- abstract functions dae solvers must implement.
BlockSolver.h -- abstract functions a solver must supply to provide
	a blocking strategy (solving precedence ordered partitions).

Services:
LPServices -- Services interface for simple LP solvers.
MILPServices -- Services interface for MILP solvers.
MonolithServices.h -- Services interface for solvers ala minos/conopt
that don't know squat about block structure in their interfaces, though
they may deal with it internally. Hopefully, they still don't and we
just have NLPHarness do all that for it.
DAEServices.h -- Services interface for solvers ala dassl/godess(hans olsson).
BlockServices -- Services interface for solvers ala ascend that want to
	know something about blocking.
VariableListServices -- info functions about variable list.
EqualityListServices -- info functions about equalities list.
InequalityListServices -- info functions about equalities list.
ObjectiveListServices -- info functions about objectives list.
ObjectiveServices -- info functions about single objectives.
