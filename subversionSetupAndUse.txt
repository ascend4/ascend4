Notes on setting up and using subversion

First you should get a copy of the subversion .pdf book and read the
first four chapters.  It is available at subversion.tigris.org.


Redhat client ----

Each person using subversion must install the subversion client on
his/her computer.  I did this for redhat linux by importing and
installing the following five rpms.

  apr-0.9.5-0.4.i386.rpm       neon-0.24.7-4.i386.rpm
  apr-util-0.9.5-0.4.i386.rpm  subversion-1.0.9-1.fc1.i386.rpm
  db42-4.2.52-0.1.i386.rpm

I have created a .tar.gz file containing all of these and put it into
LIRE'.  Admittedly it is dated, but it could help some of you to get a
quick start now.

Once installed, a typical command will be


  svn import ~/tmp/dirToBeImported \
  https://tweety.ices.cmu.edu/svn/ascend \
  -m "your comment"

Note, it is the second line in this command that is the important one.
Your access to the server is via https (you can also access via http
but that is not secure and would expose your password).


Windows client ----

This is likely an easier option to install and use.  I have not done
it, but go to subversion.tigris.org to find the client.  Note, unless
the package has the name server in it, it is the client software.
