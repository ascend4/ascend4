BUILDING LP_SOLVE

Just edit the Makefile to pick the compiler of your choice, and to set the
desired compiler options. Then type 'make'. After a succesful make, type 'make
test' to run a couple of examples and to test the results against the ones I
got. Also run program 'demo' to test the procedural interface.
