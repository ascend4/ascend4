#  This file installs the ASCEND help files into the install directory
#  HELP_DIR
#
#  This Makefile is the top level makefile for the directory tree
#  rooted here.  Typing `make' in this directory will traverse the
#  directory tree (`make' descends into the directories listed in
#  INSTALL_SUBDIR_LIST).

#  Two macros get defined here and in every Makefile in the
#  subdirectory tree:
#
#    INSTALL_SUBDIR_LIST -- lists the subdirectories of this directory
#                           which contain files to be installed
#
#    INSTALL_FILE_LIST -- lists the files that are to be installed
#                         when ASCEND is installed
#
#  Since this is the top of this directory tree, this Makefile needs
#  to define some macros that are used throughout the tree:
#
#    RULES_FILE -- a makefile that contains general rules for this
#                  directory tree; it is passed by `make' to every
#                  subdirectory and included by that directory's
#                  Makefile
#
#    INSTALL_TARGET_DIR -- the directory in which to install the files


SHELL = /bin/sh
builddir = @help_topbuilddir@/ascend4
srcdir = @srcdir@
VPATH = @srcdir@



#  the default target.  `make' without a target does nothing
default::

#  these targets install all files in this subtree
install install-libraries install-help:: Makefile.Rules install-subtree

#  unintall the files in this subtree
