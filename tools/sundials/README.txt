The .spec file in this directory can be used to package SUNDIALS for Fedora. It hasn't been recently tested.

http://ascend4.org/IDA

This packaging hasn't recently been tested (since ~2012), and may require some tweaking.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The .spec file is not present in the distribution tarball, due to problems with 'rpmbuild -ta'
with tarballs containing multiple .spec files. Please access the .spec file in our code repository.
