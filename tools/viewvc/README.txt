We use this file to prevent Google from going crazy while indexing our
ViewVC code repository.

The problem essentially is the ViewVC allows diffs to be generated for every
version of a file with all other earlier versions. This means that as the
repository grows, the Google index of this size grows exponentially (or
is it O(NÂ²)...?) in size.
