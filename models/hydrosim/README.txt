Dear John

these are all the files with our hydrometallurgy library and examples. Please note that HydroSim.a4l is made of Hydroleach (leaching models), HydroEW(electrowinning models), HydroSX (solvent extraction models), HydroBasic and HydroAtoms. I will send you a description of all the files soon
best regards
