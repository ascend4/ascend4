v2.2.5/6/7

- Fixes and enhancements to three-phase flash algorithms.

v2.2.4

- Made assembly COM-ready. Search for "regasm.exe" in the .NET 4.0 installation directory and register the library using the following commands: 
"regasm.exe /tlb:DWSIM.Thermodynamics.tlb DWSIM.Thermodynamics.dll"
"gacutil.exe -i DWSIM.Thermodynamics.dll"

v2.2.3

- Fixes and enhancements to three-phase flash algorithms.
- Added a new function (SetParameterValue) to the Property Package class to set flash algorithm parameters.

v2.2

- Fixes and enhancements to three-phase flash algorithms.
- New three-phase flash algorithm, Nested Loops (VLLE), based on the paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fluid.2005.11.011

v2.1

- Enabled GPU calculations for PR, LKP and UNIFAC Property Packages
- Fixes for some flash algorithms
- Updated data files

v2.0.1

- Added a trivial solution check to the Gibbs PT flash algorithm.
- Added an option to define an initial estimate for temperature or pressure in PH, PS, PVF and TVF flash calculations.
- Added properties to the Property Package class to specify compounds and severity of the liquid phase stability test on three-phase flash algorithms.
- Bug fixes on the Steam Tables Property Package.

v2.0

- DTL now has the same features of the thermo package in DWSIM 3, except for temperature-dependent NRTL/UNIQUAC interaction parameters, electrolyte susystem and GPU calculation support.
