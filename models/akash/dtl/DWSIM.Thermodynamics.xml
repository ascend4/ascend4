 use of multiple Property Packages. In order to identify the compounds of a Property Package, the PME will use the
 'casno’ argument instead of the compIds. The reason is that different PMEs may give different names to the same
 chemical compounds, whereas CAS Numbers are universal. Therefore, it is recommended to provide a value for the
 casno argument wherever available.</remarks>

 If the number of requested Physical Properties is P and the number of Compounds is C, the

 requested Physical Property (one variant for each Compound) followed by C values of constants
 for the second Physical Property, and so on. The actual type of values returned

 specified in section 7.5.2, is given in the table below.
 When the ICapeThermoCompounds interface is implemented by a Material Object, the list
 of Compounds returned is fixed when the Material Object is configured.
 For a Property Package component, the Property Package will normally contain a limited set
 of Compounds selected for a particular application, rather than all possible Compounds that
 could be available to a proprietary Properties System.
 The compIds returned by the GetCompoundList method must be unique within the
 component that implements the ICapeThermoCompounds interface. There is no restriction
 on the length of the strings returned in compIds. However, it should be recognised that a
 PME may restrict the length of Compound identifiers internally. In such a case the PME’s
 CAPE-OPEN socket must maintain a method of mapping the, potentially long, identifiers
 used by a CAPE-OPEN Property package component to the identifiers used within the PME.
 In order to identify the Compounds of a Property Package, the PME, or other client, will use
 the casnos argument rather than the compIds. This is because different PMEs and different
 Property Packages may give different names to the same Compounds and the casnos is
 (almost always) unique. If the casnos is not available (e.g. for petroleum fractions), or not
 unique, the other pieces of information returned by GetCompoundList can be used to
 distinguish the Compounds. It should be noted, however, that for communication with a
 Property Package a client must use the Compound identifiers returned in the compIds
 argument. It is the responsibility of the client to maintain appropriate data structures that
 allow it to reconcile the different Compound identifiers used by different Property Packages
 and any native property system.</remarks>

      <remarks>This method is provided to allow the natural logarithm of the fugacity coefficient, which is
 the most commonly used thermodynamic property, to be calculated and returned in a highly
 efficient manner.
 The temperature, pressure and composition (mole numbers) for the calculation are specified
 by the arguments and are not obtained from the Material Object by a separate request. Likewise,
 any quantities calculated are returned through the arguments and are not stored in the
 Material Object. The state of the Material Object is not affected by calling this method. It
 should be noted however, that prior to calling CalcAndGetLnPhi a valid Material Object
 must have been defined by calling the SetMaterial method on the
 ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface of the component that implements the
 ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine interface. The compounds in the Material Object must have
 been identified and the number of values supplied in the moleNumbers argument must be
 equal to the number of Compounds in the Material Object.
 The fugacity coefficient information is returned as the natural logarithm of the fugacity
 coefficient. This is because thermodynamic models naturally provide the natural logarithm
 of this quantity and also a wider range of values may be safely returned.
 The quantities actually calculated and returned by this method are controlled by an integer
 code fFlags. The code is formed by summing contributions for the property and each
 derivative required using the enumerated constants eCapeCalculationCode (defined in the
 Thermo version 1.1 IDL) shown in the following table. For example, to calculate log
 fugacity coefficients and their T-derivatives the fFlags argument would be set to
 CAPE_LOG_FUGACITY_COEFFICIENTS + CAPE_T_DERIVATIVE.
 
                                       code                            numerical value

 P-derivative                          CAPE_P_DERIVATIVE               4
 mole number derivatives               CAPE_MOLE_NUMBERS_DERIVATIVES   8
 
 If CalcAndGetLnPhi is called with fFlags set to CAPE_NO_CALCULATION no property
 values are returned.
 A typical sequence of operations for this method when implemented by a Property Package
 component would be:
 - Check that the phaseLabel specified is valid.
 - Check that the moleNumbers array contains the number of values expected
 (should be consistent with the last call to the SetMaterial method).
 - Calculate the requested properties/derivatives at the T/P/composition specified in
 the argument list.
 - Store values for the properties/derivatives in the corresponding arguments.
 Note that this calculation can be carried out irrespective of whether the Phase actually exists
 in the Material Object.</remarks>

 Components that implement this method must get the input specification for the calculation
 (temperature, pressure and composition) from the associated Material Object and set the
 results in the Material Object.
 Thermodynamic and Physical Properties Components, such as a Property Package or Property
 Calculator, must implement the ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface so that an
 ICapeThermoMaterial interface can be passed via the SetMaterial method.
 The component that implements the ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine interface (e.g. a Property
 Package or Property Calculator) must also implement the ICapeThermoPhases interface so
 that it is possible to get a list of supported phases. The phaseLabel passed to this method
 must be one of the phase labels returned by the GetPhaseList method of the
 ICapeThermoPhases interface and it must also be present in the Material Object, ie. one of
 the phase labels returned by the GetPresentPhases method of the ICapeThermoMaterial
 interface. This latter condition will be satisfied if the phase is made present explicitly by
 calling the SetPresentPhases method or if any phase properties have been set by calling the
 SetSinglePhaseProp or SetTwoPhaseProp methods.
 A typical sequence of operations for CalcSinglePhaseProp when implemented by a Property
 Package component would be:
 - Check that the phaseLabel specified is valid.
 - Use the GetTPFraction method (of the Material Object specified in the last call to the
 SetMaterial method) to get the temperature, pressure and composition of the
 specified Phase.
 - Calculate the properties.
 - Store values for the properties of the Phase in the Material Object using the
 SetSinglePhaseProp method of the ICapeThermoMaterial interface.
 CalcSinglePhaseProp will request the input Property values it requires from the Material
 Object through GetSinglePhaseProp calls. If a requested property is not available, the
 exception raised will be ECapeThrmPropertyNotAvailable. If this error occurs then the
 Property Package can return it to the client, or request a different property. Material Object
 implementations must be able to supply property values using the client’s choice of basis by
 implementing conversion from one basis to another.
 Clients should not assume that Phase fractions and Compound fractions in a Material Object
 are normalised. Fraction values may also lie outside the range 0 to 1. If fractions are not
 normalised, or are outside the expected range, it is the responsibility of the Property Package
 to decide how to deal with the situation.
 It is recommended that properties are requested one at a time in order to simplify error
 handling. However, it is recognised that there are cases where the potential efficiency gains
 of requesting several properties simultaneously are more important. One such example
 might be when a property and its derivatives are required.
 If a client uses multiple properties in a call and one of them fails then the whole call should
 be considered to have failed. This implies that no value should be written back to the Material
 Object by the Property Package until it is known that the whole request can be satisfied.
 It is likely that a PME might request values of properties for a Phase at conditions of temperature,
 pressure and composition where the Phase does not exist (according to the
 mathematical/physical models used to represent properties). The exception
 ECapeThrmPropertyNotAvailable may be raised or an extrapolated value may be returned.
 It is responsibility of the implementer to decide how to handle this circumstance.</remarks>

 order defined in the following table (hence, the specification arguments may have 3 or 4
 items):
 
 item                        meaning
 
 property identifier         The property identifier can be any of the identifiers listed in section 7.5.5 but
                             only certain property specifications will normally be supported by any
                             Equilibrium Routine.
 
 basis                       The basis for the property value. Valid settings for basis are given in section
                             7.4. Use UNDEFINED as a placeholder for a property for which basis does
                             not apply. For most Equilibrium Specifications, the result of the calculation
                             is not dependent on the basis, but, for example, for phase fraction
                             specifications the basis (Mole or Mass) does make a difference.
 
 phase label                 The phase label denotes the Phase to which the specification applies. It must
                             either be one of the labels returned by GetPresentPhases, or the special value
                             “Overall”.
 
 compound identifier         The compound identifier allows for specifications that depend on a particular
                             Compound. This item of the specification array is optional and may be
                             omitted. In case of a specification without compound identifier, the array
                             element may be present and empty, or may be absent.
                             The values corresponding to the specifications in the argument list and the overall
                             composition of the mixture must be set in the associated Material Object before a call to
                             CalcEquilibrium.
 
 Components such as a Property Package or an Equilibrium Calculator must implement the
 ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface, so that an ICapeThermoMaterial interface can be
 passed via the SetMaterial method. It is the responsibility of the implementation of
 CalcEquilibrium to validate the Material Object before attempting a calculation.
 The Phases that will be considered in the Equilibrium Calculation are those that exist in the
 Material Object, i.e. the list of phases specified in a SetPresentPhases call. This provides a
 way for a client to specify whether, for example, a vapour-liquid, liquid-liquid, or vapourliquid-
 liquid calculation is required. CalcEquilibrium must use the GetPresentPhases method
 to retrieve the list of Phases and the associated Phase status flags. The Phase status flags may
 be used by the client to provide information about the Phases, for example whether estimates
 of the equilibrium state are provided. See the description of the GetPresentPhases and
 SetPresentPhases methods of the ICapeThermoMaterial interface for details. When the
 Equilibrium Calculation has been completed successfully, the SetPresentPhases method
 must be used to specify which Phases are present at equilibrium and the Phase status flags
 for the phases should be set to Cape_AtEquilibrium. This must include any Phases that are
 present in zero amount such as the liquid Phase in a dew point calculation.
 Some types of Phase equilibrium specifications may result in more than one solution. A
 common example of this is the case of a dew point calculation. However, CalcEquilibrium
 can provide only one solution through the Material Object. The solutionType argument
 allows the “Normal” or “Retrograde” solution to be explicitly requested. When none of the
 specifications includes a phase fraction, the solutionType argument should be set to
 “Unspecified”.
 
 CalcEquilibrium must set the amounts (phase fractions), compositions, temperature and
 pressure for all Phases present at equilibrium, as well as the temperature and pressure for the
 overall mixture if not set as part of the calculation specifications. It must not set any other
 values – in particular it must not set any values for phases that are not present.
 
 As an example, the following sequence of operations might be performed by
 CalcEquilibrium in the case of an Equilibrium Calculation at fixed pressure and temperature:
 
 - With the ICapeThermoMaterial interface of the supplied Material Object:
 
 -- Use the GetPresentPhases method to find the list of Phases that the Equilibrium
 Calculation should consider.
 
 -- With the ICapeThermoCompounds interface of the Material Object use the
 GetCompoundList method to find which Compounds are present.
 
 -- Use the GetOverallProp method to get the temperature, pressure and composition
 for the overall mixture.
 
 - Perform the Equilibrium Calculation.
 
 -- Use SetPresentPhases to specify the Phases present at equilibrium and set the
 Phase status flags to Cape_AtEquilibrium.
 
 -- Use SetSinglePhaseProp to set pressure, temperature, Phase amount (or Phase
 fraction) and composition for all Phases present.</remarks>

 The result of the check should depend primarily on the capabilities and configuration
 (compounds and phases supported) of the component that implements the ICapeThermo-
 EquilibriumRoutine interface (egg. a Property package). A component that supports
 calculation specifications for any combination of supported phases is capable of checking
 the specification without any reference to a Material Object. However, it is possible that
 there may be restrictions on the combinations of phases supported in an equilibrium
 calculation. For example a component may support vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid
 calculations but not vapor-liquid-liquid calculations. In general it is therefore a necessary
 prerequisite that a Material Object has been set (using the SetMaterial method of the
 ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface) and that the SetPresentPhases method of the
 ICapeThermoMaterial interface has been called to specify the combination of phases for the
 equilibrium calculation. The result of the check should not depend on the state (temperature,
 pressure, composition etc.) of the Material Object.</remarks>

      <param name="material">The Material interface.</param>
      <remarks>The SetMaterial method allows a Thermodynamic and Physical Properties component, such
 as a Property Package, to be given the ICapeThermoMaterial interface of a Material Object.
 This interface gives the component access to the description of the Material for which
 Property Calculations or Equilibrium Calculations are required. The component can access
 property values directly using this interface. A client can also use the ICapeThermoMaterial
 interface to query a Material Object for its ICapeThermoCompounds and ICapeThermo-
 Phases interfaces, which provide access to Compound and Phase information, respectively.
 It is envisaged that the SetMaterial method will be used to check that the Material Interface
 supplied is valid and useable. For example, a Property Package may check that there are
 some Compounds in a Material Object and that those Compounds can be identified by the
 Property Package. In addition a Property Package may perform any initialisation that
 depends on the configuration of a Material Object. A Property Calculator component might
 typically use this method to query the Material Object for any required information
 concerning the Compounds.
 Calling the UnsetMaterial method of the ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface has the
 effect of removing the interface set by the SetMaterial method.
 After a call to SetMaterial() has been received, the object implementing the ICapeThermo-
 MaterialContext interface can assume that the number, name and order of compounds for
 that Material Object will remain fixed until the next call to SetMaterial() or UnsetMaterial().</remarks>

      <remarks>The GetConstPropList method can be used in order to check which constant Physical

 If the number of requested Physical Properties is P and the number of Compounds is C, the

 requested Physical Property (one variant for each Compound) followed by C values of constants
 for the second Physical Property, and so on. The actual type of values returned
 (Double, String, etc.) depends on the Physical Property as specified in section 7.5.2.
 Physical Properties are returned in a fixed set of units as specified in section 7.5.2.

 between GetCompoundList arguments and Compound constant Physical Properties, as
 specified in section 7.5.2, is given in the table below.
 When the ICapeThermoCompounds interface is implemented by a Material Object, the list
 of Compounds returned is fixed when the Material Object is configured.
 For a Property Package component, the Property Package will normally contain a limited set
 of Compounds selected for a particular application, rather than all possible Compounds that
 could be available to a proprietary Properties System.
 The compIds returned by the GetCompoundList method must be unique within the
 component that implements the ICapeThermoCompounds interface. There is no restriction
 on the length of the strings returned in compIds. However, it should be recognised that a
 PME may restrict the length of Compound identifiers internally. In such a case the PME’s
 CAPE-OPEN socket must maintain a method of mapping the, potentially long, identifiers
 used by a CAPE-OPEN Property package component to the identifiers used within the PME.
 In order to identify the Compounds of a Property Package, the PME, or other client, will use
 the casnos argument rather than the compIds. This is because different PMEs and different
 Property Packages may give different names to the same Compounds and the casnos is
 (almost always) unique. If the casnos is not available (e.g. for petroleum fractions), or not
 unique, the other pieces of information returned by GetCompoundList can be used to
 distinguish the Compounds. It should be noted, however, that for communication with a
 Property Package a client must use the Compound identifiers returned in the compIds
 argument. It is the responsibility of the client to maintain appropriate data structures that
 allow it to reconcile the different Compound identifiers used by different Property Packages
 and any native property system.</remarks>

      <remarks>The Physical Property values returned by GetOverallProp refer to the overall mixture. These

 not calculated by components that implement the ICapeThermoMaterial interface. The
 property values are only used as input specifications for the CalcEquilibrium method of a
 component that implements the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface.
 It is expected that this method will normally be able to provide Physical Property values on
 any basis, i.e. it should be able to convert values from the basis on which they are stored to
 the basis requested. This operation will not always be possible. For example, if the
 molecular weight is not known for one or more Compounds, it is not possible to convert
 between a mass basis and a molar basis.
 Although the result of some calls to GetOverallProp will be a single value, the return type is
 CapeArrayDouble and the method must always return an array even if it contains only a

      <param name="phaseStatus">
      </param>
      <remarks>A Phase is ‘present’ in a Material Object (or other component that implements the
 ICapeThermoMaterial interface) if it has been explicitly made present by calling the
 SetPresentPhases method or if any properties have been set by calling the
 SetSinglePhaseProp or SetTwoPhaseProp methods. Even if a Phase is present, it does not
 necessarily imply that any Physical Properties are actually set unless the phaseStatus is
 Cape_AtEquilibrium or Cape_Estimates (see below). Note that calling the SetPresentPhases
 method of the ICapeThermoMaterial interface will cause any phases not specified in its
 phaseLabels list to not present, even if previously present as a result of a SetSingle-
 PhaseProp or SetTwoPhaseProp call.
 If no Phases are present, UNDEFINED should be returned for both the phaseLabels and
 phaseStatus arguments.
 The phaseStatus argument contains as many entries as there are Phase labels. The valid
 settings are listed in the following table:
 
 Identifier                    Meaning
 Cape_UnknownPhaseStatus       This is the normal setting when a Phase is specified as being available for an Equilibrium Calculation.
 Cape_AtEquilibrium            The Phase has been set as present as a result of an Equilibrium Calculation.
 Cape_Estimates                Estimates of the equilibrium state have been set in the Material Object.
 
 All the Phases with a status of Cape_AtEquilibrium have values of temperature, pressure,
 composition and Phase fraction set that correspond to an equilibrium state, i.e. equal
 temperature, pressure and fugacities of each Compound. Phases with a Cape_Estimates
 status have values of temperature, pressure, composition and Phase fraction set in the
 Material Object. These values are available for use by an Equilibrium Calculator component
 to initialise an Equilibrium Calculation. The stored values are available but there is no
 guarantee that they will be used.
 GetPresentPhases is intended to be used in several contexts.
 A Property Package, Property Calculator or other PMC may use this method to check
 whether a phase is present in the Material Object prior to requesting and/or calculating
 some properties.
 An Equilibrium Calculator component will use this method to obtain the list of phases to
 consider in an equilibrium calculation or when checking an equilibrium specification
 (see below for more details).
 The method will be used by the PME or PMC to obtain the list of phases present as the
 result of an equilibrium calculation (see below for more details).
 A Unit Operation (or other PMC) will use this method to get the list of phases present at
 an inlet port or during its calculations.
 In the context of Equilibrium Calculations the GetPresentPhases method is intended to work
 in conjunction with the SetPresentPhases method. Together these methods provide a means
 of communication between a PME (or another client) and an Equilibrium Calculator (or
 other component that implements the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface). The
 following sequence of operations is envisaged.
 
 1. Prior to requesting an Equilibrium Calculation, a PME will use the SetPresentPhases
 method to define a list of Phases that may be considered in the Equilibrium
 Calculation. Typically, this is necessary because an Equilibrium Calculator may be
 capable of handling a large number of Phases but for a particular application, it may
 be known that only certain Phases will be involved. For example, if the complete
 Phase list contains Phases with the following labels (with the obvious interpretation):
 vapour, hydrocarbonLiquid and aqueousLiquid and it is required to model a liquid
 decanter, the present Phases might be set to hydrocarbonLiquid and aqueousLiquid.
 
 2. The GetPresentPhases method is then used by the CalcEquilibrium method of the
 ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface to obtain the list of Phase labels corresponding
 to the Phases that may be present at equilibrium.
 
 3. The Equilibrium Calculation determines which Phases actually co-exist at
 equilibrium. This list of Phases may be a sub-set of the Phases considered because
 some Phases may not be present at the prevailing conditions. For example, if the
 amount of water is sufficiently small the aqueousLiquid Phase in the above example
 may not exist because all the water dissolves in the hydrocarbonLiquid Phase.
 
 4. The CalcEquilibrium method uses the SetPresentPhases method to indicate the
 Phases present following the equilibrium calculation (and sets the phase properties).
 
 5. The PME uses the GetPresentPhases method to find out the Phases present following
 the calculation and it can then use the GetSinglePhaseProp or GetTPFraction
 methods to get the Phase properties.</remarks>

 A Phase is ‘present’ in a Material if its identifier is returned by the GetPresentPhases

 The Physical Property values returned by GetTwoPhaseProp depend on two Phases, for
 example surface tension or K-values. These values may be set by the SetTwoPhaseProp
 method that may be called directly, or by other methods such as the CalcTwoPhaseProp
 method of the ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine interface, or the CalcEquilibrium method of the

 It is expected that this method will normally be able to provide Physical Property values on

 If a composition derivative is requested this means that the derivatives are returned for both
 Phases in the order in which the Phase labels are specified. The number of values returned
 for a composition derivative will depend on the dimensionality of the property. For example,
 if there are N Compounds then the results vector for the surface tension derivative will
 contain N composition derivative values for the first Phase, followed by N composition
 derivative values for the second Phase. For K-value derivative there will be N2 derivative
 values for the first phase followed by N2 values for the second phase in the order defined in
 7.6.2.</remarks>

      <remarks>SetPresentPhases is intended to be used in the following ways:
 * To restrict an Equilibrium Calculation (using the CalcEquilibrium method of a
 component that implements the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface) to a subset
 of the Phases supported by the Property Package component;
 * When the component that implements the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface
 needs to specify which Phases are present in a Material Object after an Equilibrium
 Calculation has been performed.
 * In the context of dynamic simulations to specify the state of a Material Object that is an
 output of a unit operation. This is the equivalent of calculating equilibrium in steadystate
 simulations.
 If a Phase in the list is already present, its Physical Properties are unchanged by the action of
 this method. Any Phases not in the list when SetPresentPhases is called are removed from
 the Material Object. This means that any Physical Property values that may have been stored
 on the removed Phases are no longer available (i.e. a call to GetSinglePhaseProp or
 GetTwoPhaseProp including this Phase will return an exception). A call to the
 GetPresentPhases method of the Material Object will return the same list as specified by
 SetPresentPhases.

 Identifier                 Meaning
 Cape_UnknownPhaseStatus    This is the normal setting when a Phase is specified as being available for an Equilibrium Calculation.
 Cape_AtEquilibrium         The Phase has been set as present as a result of an Equilibrium Calculation.
 Cape_Estimates             Estimates of the equilibrium state have been set in the Material Object.
 
 All the Phases with a status of Cape_AtEquilibrium must have properties that correspond to
 an equilibrium state, i.e. equal temperature, pressure and fugacities of each Compound (this
 does not imply that the fugacities are set as a result of the Equilibrium Calculation). The
 Cape_AtEquilibrium status should be set by the CalcEquilibrium method of a component
 that implements the ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine interface following a successful
 Equilibrium Calculation. If the temperature, pressure or composition of an equilibrium Phase
 is changed, the Material Object implementation is responsible for resetting the status of the
 Phase to Cape_UnknownPhaseStatus. Other property values stored for that Phase should not
 be affected.
 Phases with an Estimates status must have values of temperature, pressure, composition and
 phase fraction set in the Material Object. These values are available for use by an
 Equilibrium Calculator component to initialise an Equilibrium Calculation. The stored
 values are available but there is no guarantee that they will be used.</remarks>

 The Physical Property values set by SetTwoPhaseProp depend on two Phases, for example
 surface tension or K-values. Properties that depend on a single Phase are set by the
 SetSinglePhaseProp method.
 If a Physical Property with composition derivative is specified, the derivative values will be
 set for both Phases in the order in which the Phase labels are specified. The number of
 values returned for a composition derivative will depend on the property. For example, if
 there are N Compounds then the values vector for the surface tension derivative will contain
 N composition derivative values for the first Phase, followed by N composition derivative
 values for the second Phase. For K-values there will be N2 derivative values for the first
 phase followed by N2 values for the second phase in the order defined in 7.6.2.
 To set a property using SetTwoPhaseProp, phaseLabels identifiers should be passed that are

      <remarks>This method is provided to allow the natural logarithm of the fugacity coefficient, which is
 the most commonly used thermodynamic property, to be calculated and returned in a highly
 efficient manner.
 The temperature, pressure and composition (mole numbers) for the calculation are specified
 by the arguments and are not obtained from the Material Object by a separate request. Likewise,
 any quantities calculated are returned through the arguments and are not stored in the
 Material Object. The state of the Material Object is not affected by calling this method. It
 should be noted however, that prior to calling CalcAndGetLnPhi a valid Material Object
 must have been defined by calling the SetMaterial method on the
 ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface of the component that implements the
 ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine interface. The compounds in the Material Object must have
 been identified and the number of values supplied in the moleNumbers argument must be
 equal to the number of Compounds in the Material Object.
 The fugacity coefficient information is returned as the natural logarithm of the fugacity
 coefficient. This is because thermodynamic models naturally provide the natural logarithm
 of this quantity and also a wider range of values may be safely returned.
 The quantities actually calculated and returned by this method are controlled by an integer
 code fFlags. The code is formed by summing contributions for the property and each
 derivative required using the enumerated constants eCapeCalculationCode (defined in the
 Thermo version 1.1 IDL) shown in the following table. For example, to calculate log
 fugacity coefficients and their T-derivatives the fFlags argument would be set to
 CAPE_LOG_FUGACITY_COEFFICIENTS + CAPE_T_DERIVATIVE.
 
                                       code                            numerical value

 mole number derivatives               CAPE_MOLE_NUMBERS_DERIVATIVES   8
 
 If CalcAndGetLnPhi is called with fFlags set to CAPE_NO_CALCULATION no property
 values are returned.
 A typical sequence of operations for this method when implemented by a Property Package
 component would be:
 - Check that the phaseLabel specified is valid.
 - Check that the moleNumbers array contains the number of values expected
 (should be consistent with the last call to the SetMaterial method).
 - Calculate the requested properties/derivatives at the T/P/composition specified in
 the argument list.
 - Store values for the properties/derivatives in the corresponding arguments.
 Note that this calculation can be carried out irrespective of whether the Phase actually exists
 in the Material Object.</remarks>

      <remarks>CalcSinglePhaseProp calculates properties, such as enthalpy or viscosity that are defined for
 a single Phase. Physical Properties that depend on more than one Phase, for example surface
 tension or K-values, are handled by CalcTwoPhaseProp method.
 Components that implement this method must get the input specification for the calculation
 (temperature, pressure and composition) from the associated Material Object and set the
 results in the Material Object.
 Thermodynamic and Physical Properties Components, such as a Property Package or Property
 Calculator, must implement the ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface so that an
 ICapeThermoMaterial interface can be passed via the SetMaterial method.
 The component that implements the ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine interface (e.g. a Property
 Package or Property Calculator) must also implement the ICapeThermoPhases interface so
 that it is possible to get a list of supported phases. The phaseLabel passed to this method
 must be one of the phase labels returned by the GetPhaseList method of the
 ICapeThermoPhases interface and it must also be present in the Material Object, ie. one of
 the phase labels returned by the GetPresentPhases method of the ICapeThermoMaterial
 interface. This latter condition will be satisfied if the phase is made present explicitly by
 calling the SetPresentPhases method or if any phase properties have been set by calling the
 SetSinglePhaseProp or SetTwoPhaseProp methods.
 A typical sequence of operations for CalcSinglePhaseProp when implemented by a Property
 Package component would be:
 - Check that the phaseLabel specified is valid.
 - Use the GetTPFraction method (of the Material Object specified in the last call to the
 SetMaterial method) to get the temperature, pressure and composition of the
 specified Phase.
 - Calculate the properties.
 - Store values for the properties of the Phase in the Material Object using the
 SetSinglePhaseProp method of the ICapeThermoMaterial interface.
 CalcSinglePhaseProp will request the input Property values it requires from the Material
 Object through GetSinglePhaseProp calls. If a requested property is not available, the
 exception raised will be ECapeThrmPropertyNotAvailable. If this error occurs then the
 Property Package can return it to the client, or request a different property. Material Object
 implementations must be able to supply property values using the client’s choice of basis by
 implementing conversion from one basis to another.
 Clients should not assume that Phase fractions and Compound fractions in a Material Object
 are normalised. Fraction values may also lie outside the range 0 to 1. If fractions are not
 normalised, or are outside the expected range, it is the responsibility of the Property Package
 to decide how to deal with the situation.
 It is recommended that properties are requested one at a time in order to simplify error
 handling. However, it is recognised that there are cases where the potential efficiency gains
 of requesting several properties simultaneously are more important. One such example
 might be when a property and its derivatives are required.
 If a client uses multiple properties in a call and one of them fails then the whole call should
 be considered to have failed. This implies that no value should be written back to the Material
 Object by the Property Package until it is known that the whole request can be satisfied.
 It is likely that a PME might request values of properties for a Phase at conditions of temperature,
 pressure and composition where the Phase does not exist (according to the
 mathematical/physical models used to represent properties). The exception
 ECapeThrmPropertyNotAvailable may be raised or an extrapolated value may be returned.
 It is responsibility of the implementer to decide how to handle this circumstance.</remarks>

 property identifier         The property identifier can be any of the identifiers listed in section 7.5.5 but
                             only certain property specifications will normally be supported by any

                             7.4. Use UNDEFINED as a placeholder for a property for which basis does
                             not apply. For most Equilibrium Specifications, the result of the calculation
                             is not dependent on the basis, but, for example, for phase fraction
                             specifications the basis (Mole or Mass) does make a difference.
 
 phase label                 The phase label denotes the Phase to which the specification applies. It must
                             either be one of the labels returned by GetPresentPhases, or the special value
                             “Overall”.
 
 compound identifier         The compound identifier allows for specifications that depend on a particular
                             Compound. This item of the specification array is optional and may be
                             omitted. In case of a specification without compound identifier, the array
                             element may be present and empty, or may be absent.
                             The values corresponding to the specifications in the argument list and the overall
                             composition of the mixture must be set in the associated Material Object before a call to
                             CalcEquilibrium.
 
 Components such as a Property Package or an Equilibrium Calculator must implement the
 ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface, so that an ICapeThermoMaterial interface can be
 passed via the SetMaterial method. It is the responsibility of the implementation of
 CalcEquilibrium to validate the Material Object before attempting a calculation.
 The Phases that will be considered in the Equilibrium Calculation are those that exist in the
 Material Object, i.e. the list of phases specified in a SetPresentPhases call. This provides a
 way for a client to specify whether, for example, a vapour-liquid, liquid-liquid, or vapourliquid-
 liquid calculation is required. CalcEquilibrium must use the GetPresentPhases method
 to retrieve the list of Phases and the associated Phase status flags. The Phase status flags may
 be used by the client to provide information about the Phases, for example whether estimates
 of the equilibrium state are provided. See the description of the GetPresentPhases and
 SetPresentPhases methods of the ICapeThermoMaterial interface for details. When the
 Equilibrium Calculation has been completed successfully, the SetPresentPhases method
 must be used to specify which Phases are present at equilibrium and the Phase status flags
 for the phases should be set to Cape_AtEquilibrium. This must include any Phases that are
 present in zero amount such as the liquid Phase in a dew point calculation.
 Some types of Phase equilibrium specifications may result in more than one solution. A
 common example of this is the case of a dew point calculation. However, CalcEquilibrium
 can provide only one solution through the Material Object. The solutionType argument
 allows the “Normal” or “Retrograde” solution to be explicitly requested. When none of the
 specifications includes a phase fraction, the solutionType argument should be set to
 “Unspecified”.
 
 CalcEquilibrium must set the amounts (phase fractions), compositions, temperature and
 pressure for all Phases present at equilibrium, as well as the temperature and pressure for the
 overall mixture if not set as part of the calculation specifications. It must not set any other
 values – in particular it must not set any values for phases that are not present.
 
 As an example, the following sequence of operations might be performed by
 CalcEquilibrium in the case of an Equilibrium Calculation at fixed pressure and temperature:
 
 - With the ICapeThermoMaterial interface of the supplied Material Object:
 
 -- Use the GetPresentPhases method to find the list of Phases that the Equilibrium
 Calculation should consider.
 
 -- With the ICapeThermoCompounds interface of the Material Object use the
 GetCompoundList method to find which Compounds are present.
 
 -- Use the GetOverallProp method to get the temperature, pressure and composition
 for the overall mixture.
 
 - Perform the Equilibrium Calculation.
 
 -- Use SetPresentPhases to specify the Phases present at equilibrium and set the
 Phase status flags to Cape_AtEquilibrium.
 
 -- Use SetSinglePhaseProp to set pressure, temperature, Phase amount (or Phase
 fraction) and composition for all Phases present.</remarks>

 The result of the check should depend primarily on the capabilities and configuration

 the specification without any reference to a Material Object. However, it is possible that
 there may be restrictions on the combinations of phases supported in an equilibrium
 calculation. For example a component may support vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid
 calculations but not vapor-liquid-liquid calculations. In general it is therefore a necessary
 prerequisite that a Material Object has been set (using the SetMaterial method of the
 ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface) and that the SetPresentPhases method of the
 ICapeThermoMaterial interface has been called to specify the combination of phases for the
 equilibrium calculation. The result of the check should not depend on the state (temperature,

 interface to query a Material Object for its ICapeThermoCompounds and ICapeThermo-
 Phases interfaces, which provide access to Compound and Phase information, respectively.
 It is envisaged that the SetMaterial method will be used to check that the Material Interface
 supplied is valid and useable. For example, a Property Package may check that there are
 some Compounds in a Material Object and that those Compounds can be identified by the
 Property Package. In addition a Property Package may perform any initialisation that
 depends on the configuration of a Material Object. A Property Calculator component might
 typically use this method to query the Material Object for any required information
 concerning the Compounds.
 Calling the UnsetMaterial method of the ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface has the
 effect of removing the interface set by the SetMaterial method.
 After a call to SetMaterial() has been received, the object implementing the ICapeThermo-
 MaterialContext interface can assume that the number, name and order of compounds for
 that Material Object will remain fixed until the next call to SetMaterial() or UnsetMaterial().</remarks>

    <member name="M:DTL.DTL.SimulationObjects.Streams.MaterialStream.UnsetMaterial">
      <summary>
 Removes any previously set Material interface.
 </summary>
      <remarks>The UnsetMaterial method removes any Material interface previously set by a call to the
 SetMaterial method of the ICapeThermoMaterialContext interface. This means that any
 methods of other interfaces that depend on having a valid Material Interface, for example
 methods of the ICapeThermoPropertyRoutine or ICapeThermoEquilibriumRoutine
 interfaces, should behave in the same way as if the SetMaterial method had never been
 called.
 If UnsetMaterial is called before a call to SetMaterial it has no effect and no exception
 should be raised.</remarks>
