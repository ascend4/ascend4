	Calculations of isentropic shocks in air flow, following approach given

	Intention is to be able to generalise these models for arbitrary fluids as
	supported by FPROPS. But the present models include ideal gas and constant

	Flow from reservoir at 20°C, 500 kPa to receiver at 200 and 300 kPa.
	Potter & Wiggert 3rd SI Edition, Example 9.2.

	We assume the flow is through a converging-only nozzle from the reservoir 
	into the receiver. As such, either the entire flow is subsonic, or else
	there will be choked flow with M = 1 in the exit of the nozzle.

	'crit' uses upstream conditions to determine the reservoir pressure that
	will give M = 1 at the exit. Then, in part (a), the receiver pressure is
	higher than that critical pressure, so subsonic flow occurs. For (b), the
	pressure is lower, so choked flow occurs, with flow rate limited by the
	M_exit = 1 choked-flow limit.

	Tested, works OK -- JP

	Converging-diverging nozzle with exit 40 cm² and throat 10 cm², with flow
	coming from reservoir at 20 °C, 500 kPa. Two different exit pressures can
	result in M = 1 at the throat -- we calculate what those pressure are.

	For this problem, saturation states are the upstream reservoir, and we
	assert that A_star is the throat area and A is the exit area. These areas
	then yield the Mach number from eq 9.3.19 (iteratively). We find the two
	solutions by having two instances of the 'isentropic_saturation' model, and
	impose upper and lower bounds on M in each of the two models.
