/**
	Any function that you want to solve using the 'zeroin_solve' function
	needs to conform to this function prototype. Any parameters required
	internally by the function can be passed in to the function as a pointer
	to a struct, array, etc, via the void 'user_data' pointer. Your subject
	function can then cast the pointer to its correct type, and access the
	necesssary parameter data, for example:

	-- in your main code
	typedef struct{double param1, param2} MyData;
	MyData D = {100., 3.141};
	double myfunc(double x, void *user_data){
		MyData *D1 = (MyData *)user_data;
		return x * D1->param1 + D1->param2;
	}
	zeroin_solve(&myfunc, &D, ...);

	@param tol maximum permissible magnitude of the function at the solved root location
	@param user_data additional data that will be passed to the subject function func.

	@param error (returned) the value of 'y' at the solution.
