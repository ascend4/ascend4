TEST CODE FOR FPROPS
====================

This directory contains some test code other than what is embedded in the
fluids files (eg ../fluids/water.c and many others).

This can be conveniently run using the '../test.py' script, but perhaps
eventually we'll wrap the whole lot up into a formalised C-based test suite, or
maybe a hybrid C/Python suite.
