	There are a number of possible ways to specify the reference point that
	defines the absolute scale for enthalpy h and entropy s. The approach of
	IAPWS95 is to state u=0 and s=0 at for saturated liquid. Other correlations
	give h=0, s=0 at certain conditions. It seems that we might need to
	facilitate a few different ways of dealing with this stuff, so we'll
	provide a data structure here that allows a few different options.

	For chemical reactions, we need to use a reference state defined by the
	enthalpy of formation and absolute entropy at defined conditions. Many 
	sources seem to specify ~ambient pressure and ~25 degC, but RPP specifes
	298.2 K and 'ideal gas', which I take to mean zero pressure. I am not sure
	that case is correctly handled by FPROPS_REF_TPHG -- still working on that.
