This function was originally taken from the Ankit branch.  I have modified it so that the equation is not "deflated" by dividing by the pressure.
Because we are using specific volume, and in some cases large pressure, we may need a more numerically sound method that won't return nan's
Should probably be put somewhere else if used.
In this case, coefficients are AZ^3+BZ^2+CZ+D.  SPM

John Pye has modifed further to assume A = 1
