	of the form

		A0_I * tau^P

	Terms containing exponential expressions with tau, like

	where x = beta / T. Instead of representing in terms of beta, we ask the
	user to provide (b,beta) in the form of

		b,beta

	We also need to know T* where tau = T* / T, the normalisation temperature
	used to calculate tau in the main 'residual' correlation.

	See J R Cooper 'Representation of the Ideal-Gas Thermaldynamic
	Properties of Water', Int J Thermophys v 3 no 1, 1982 and also
	Span, Lemmon, Jacobsen & Wagner 'A Reference Quality Equation of State 
	for Nitrogen' 1998.

	From the above expression, the term appearing in the reduced
	Helmholtz function equation becomes

		b_i ln [ 1 - exp( -beta*tau/Tstar ) ]

	As well as this term, there is a constant term and a term linear in tau
	that we can ignore because the values of those constants can be determined
	from fixing the value of h0 and s0.
