/* SCons will create the file 'fluids_list.h' automatically using the file
'fluids_list.h.in as a basis. A listing of *.c files in the 'fluids' directory
is used to create that list, so in fact no special code is required to add a new
fluid to FPROPS other than just running SCons and recompiling FPROPS again. */
