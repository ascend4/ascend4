REQUIRE "atoms.a4l";

(* 
This model was contributed by Ioan-Alexandru Lazar, 2009. It still needs
checking and validation by the ASCEND team.

This model implements a simple PV module, as described by Duffie & Beckman,
Chapter 23.2.	

The atoms are defined in this file for brevity; conductance should really go
into atoms.a4l. ctc and vtc are application-specific and should probably stay
here, or go into a separate file required only by PV-related application.

The model is purely demonstrative. It does not take into account the dependence
between the maximum power point efficiency and temperature. It is also left
unparameterized, in the idea that it is rather unlikely for several instances
of this model to be used in another model.

	NOTES
		'reference conditions' SELF {Reference conditions are defined by reference temperature and irradiance, open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. Under these conditions, we can obtain a reference load current (equal to the short-circuit current), a reference inverse current through the diode and the value of a under these conditions. The open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are usually provided by the producer or measured directly. Standard irradiance is equal to the solar constant and roughly taken as 1,000 throughout this model. The reference temperature is usually supplied by the producer as well; if not, it is measured directly when the other reference values are taken.}
