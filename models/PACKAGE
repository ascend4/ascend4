# This file contains a list of the models in the local directory
# that will be included in source and/or binary distributions of ASCEND. 
# This approach ensures that only files which have been checked end up
# on the systems of our (new) users.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments, which allows these files to be used as
# descrptive summaries of the *main* stuff in any given directory.
#
# Subdirectories need not be mentioned; if they contain a PACKAGE file, they
# will be included; if they don't, they will not.
#
# Files commented out with '###' needed testing/reformatting before being
# released.

# NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
#
# BEFORE ADDING A NEW FILE HERE, ENSURE THAT YOUR MODEL IS EQUIPPED WITH A
# 'self_test' METHOD AND IS ADDED TO THE TEST SUITE IN ../test.py. THIS WILL
# ENSURE THAT MODELS ARE NOT RELEASED WITHOUT BEING KNOWN TO AT LEAST WORK IN
# OUR TEST ENVIRONMENTS.
