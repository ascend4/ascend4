# this file contains a list of the models in the local directory
# that will be included in source and/or binary distributions of ASCEND. 
# This approach ensures that only files which have been checked end up

# Lines starting with # are comments, which allows these files to be used as

# Subdirectories need not be mentioned; if they contain a PACKAGE file, they
# will be included; if they don't, they will not.
