Equation of state models and calculation of 
compressibility as a function of reduced Temperatures
and pressures.  

eos.a4c : Models for ideal gas, van der waals, pengrobinson
          Redlich Kwong and Soave Redlich Kwong (along with models
          that can be used to test them) 
eos.a4s : tcltk script to run many/most models in eos.a4c 

eos-pengrobinson.a4c : pretty much what's there in eos.a4c, except
                       there is a method called zplot (in python) 
                       to plot Z as a function of Tr and Pr 
eos-rk.a4c : Redlich Kwong (Z as a function of Tr and Pr also) 
eos-srk.a4c : Soave Redlich Kwong (Z(Tr, Pr)) 
eos-vdw.a4c : Vander Waals (Z(Tr, Pr)) 
zplot.py : Python script/files for plotting (written by John Pye)
