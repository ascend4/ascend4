(*
 * This file demonstrates how associative arrays of variables and relations
 * are handled in the case of definition over the empty set.
 * In version ascend IV 0.8 and all previous C versions, the handling
 * is inconsistent between FOR and non-FOR defined structures.
 *
 * The specified behavior is:
 * - all cases marked (* empty *) here should compile an empty array stub.
 * - all other cases should compile an array of the specified object even if,
 * as in the case of ra1 and ra2, that object is not mathematically
 * sensible. Productions such as ra1,ra2 should be allowed but warned
 * about vociferously.
 *
 * An action plan to bring the compiler up to the specification is not yet
 * in place, especially since the entire implementation strategy for
 * associative arrays and FOR statements needs to be redesigned due to
 * other problems in compiler instruction scheduling.
