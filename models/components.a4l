 **  CONTENTS:	ASCEND structure for component physical property constants.
 **		   All anticipated constants which may be used by the models
 **		   of "thermodynamics.a4l" are created in a general model where
 **		   a consistent reference state (298.15{K} and 1.0{atm}) is
 **		   chosen.  Specific refinements to actual chemical species are
 **		   made UNIVERSAL to ensure only one instantiation of the
 **		   constants for each component is maintained throughout a
 **		   user's simulation.  A reference enthalpy and entropy is
 **		   chosen by default to be those of formation of the component
 **		   from its elements at the reference state.
