# The models used in this script are not intended to be reusable, nor
# to be examples of good style, nor to be read by anyone except system
# developers. They are included as part of the ascend library to prove
# that we really do test things before we put them out on the net. We
# test a lot more than what is shown here. Here we have boundary and
# completeness tests for features not ordinarily exercised in
# tastefully written models.

### The following tests document one or more known bugs.
### These need to be fixed, but are sufficiently marginal in
### impact that we are not panicking about getting the fix
### done yesterday.
### These cases arise because with a small syntax you cannot
### stop some really bizarre productions.
