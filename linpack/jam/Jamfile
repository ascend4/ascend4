#
# This Jamfile builds the generic Ascend linpack functionality as a
# static library.  This library comprises a linpack subset common to
# minos, lsode, and other F77 codes connected to Ascend.
#
# If you have a linpack library (e.g. liblpak.a or liblpak.lib) tuned
# to your hardware, use it instead.  To do that, set the LPAKLIB
# variable in the corresponding Ascend executable Jamfile
# (e.g. ../../tcltk/jam/Jamfile) to point that library's
# location (e.g., /usr/lib/liblinpack.a or c:\\linpack\\lib\\liblinpack.lib)
#
# The Ascend jam build system currently supports building the library
# under Linux with gcc/g77, and under Windows with the MinGW and
# Watcom FORTRAN compilers.  With use of the included Jambase file,
# it should work with both the original (http://www.perforce.com) and
# ftjam (http://www.freetype.org/jam/index.html) variants of jam.
# The system was developed primarily using ftjam.
#
# The library is built in ./CONFIGTYPE/COMPILER where
#     CONFIGTYPE = Debug, Release
#     COMPILER   = mingw, watcom, linux
#
# Installation of the library or headers is not supported at this time.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Build Instructions
#
# 1. jam must be installed and configured for the OS/compiler in use.
#
# 2. If necessary, manually edit ../../jam/Jamrules_general and this
#    Jamfile to set configuration and local directory options.
#
# 3. Run jam from using the provided Jambase:
#       jam -f ../../jam/Jambase_general linpack
#
