#  This file builds the libpack routines common to minos,
#  lsode, and other F77 codes connected to ASCEND.
#
#  If you have a linpack library (liblpak.a) tuned to your hardware, use it
#  instead; to do that, set the LPAKLIB variable in ConfigAscend to point
#  that library's location (e.g., /usr/lib/liblpak.a)
#
#  If you add files to these targets, please update the README.FORTRAN
#  in the ascend4/config directory
#
