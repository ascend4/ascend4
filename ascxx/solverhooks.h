	Implementation of solver hooks on the C++ side, for accessing by the
	'slvreq.h' language features (SOLVER, OPTION, SOLVE) in ASCEND METHODS.
	This code allows us to make the GUI do things upon instruction from methods
	being run in the MODEL.

	GUI will use different hooks to the pure C++ API (see testslvreq.cpp).

	getHooks(), the SetHooksManager will assign a default C++ SolverHooks
