BUILDING AND INSTALLING ASCEND

Thanks for downloading ASCEND! We hope you'll find it straight-
forward to set up and run ASCEND. If you have any comments on
your experience with this, we're very keen to hear about that.
Please check out the up-to-date contact details at:
https://pse.cheme.cmu.edu/wiki/view/Ascend/WebHome

There are older versions of this document, which include instructions
on how to build ASCEND with GNU Autotools. This may or may not work
with the version you are currently looking at.

-----
BUILDING ON LINUX AND WINDOWS

To build ASCEND we now recommend using SCons. This is supported
both on Windows (using the MinGW toolset) and Linux. Build scripts for using
jam and GNU Autotools are also provided although these scripts will not allow
you access to the full range of ASCEND functionality. The Autotools
scripts will only build the tcl/tk interface version.

ASCEND provides two possible interfaces. The older, more mature
GUI is based on Tcl/Tk. A newer interface that is more in keeping
with modern GUI design is implemented using PyGTK, but it is still
missing some functionality and actively being developed.

Using SCons 0.96.92 or newer, see your build options by typing

  scons -Qh

You can add your build options to a file in this directory
which you can create, called 'config.py'.

Then to build ASCEND, type

  scons

SCons will tell you what version(s) of ASCEND it is able to build, and then
proceed to start the build. The PyGTK interface requires Python (which is
already present if you have SCons!). The Tcl/Tk interface requires that you 
have Tcl/Tk and TkTable installed on your system.

------
RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME

If you've build ASCEND from source, you don't need to 'install'
it before you can run it. The main issue with running from the
source directories is that you need to set various environment
variables: 

ASCENDLIBRARY
  Location of the 'models' directory, eg ~/src/ascend-NNN/models

LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  Must contain the paths to the ascend shared libraries, in
  particular libascend.so, or for the Tcl/Tk interface, also
  libascendtcl.so.
  
It can often be easier to simply install in your home directory
as shown below.

------
ISSUES WITH THE TCL/TK INTERFACE

It can sometimes be a bit challenging to build the Tcl/Tk
interface. ASCEND can run with Tcl/Tk version 8.4 but it is more stable when
using Tcl/Tk version 8.3. 

A suggested approach in this case is to download and install the 'ActiveTcl'
distribution, version 8.3.5, and to install it in ~/activetcl.
http://downloads.activestate.com/ActiveTcl/Windows/8.3.5/

Then, you should be able to build the Tcl/Tk interface as shown:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/activetcl/lib:~/activetcl/lib/Tktable2.8
  scons TCL=~/activetcl

See also the TCL_LIB and TK_LIB flags (scons -Qh).

------
INSTALLING ON LINUX

To then install ASCEND, you will need to have write access to the 
directories INSTALL_DATA, INSTALL_BIN as specified in your
SCons configuration. You can then type

  scons install
    
The simplest way to install ASCEND 'off-root' is something like:

  scons INSTALL_PREFIX=~/ascroot
  
Note that if you install (or run) ASCEND off-root, you need to
ensure that Linux can access the shared libraries. For example,
in the above case, you would need to add

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/ascroot/lib

------
INSTALLING ON WINDOWS

To build a Windows installer (a 'setup.exe') for the PyGTK GUI,
you will need to have the NSIS installer-creator installed on
your system (which is free, at http://nsis.sf.net/). Then you 
should simply need to type

  scons installer

This will leave an installer package named 'ascend-NNNNN.exe'
in the pygtk/interface directory, with NNNNN being the version number specified
at the top of the SConstruct file.

------
CREATING AN RPM/DEB PACKAGE

Many users prefer to keep their systems clear of unpackaged
software. For this reason, we aim to provide the ability to build 
ASCEND as an RPM package. There is a "SPEC" file included in the
source tree. If you have a source package, such as for example
ascend-NNNNN.tar.bz2, place it in your home directory, then
type the following

  rpmbuild -ta ascend-NNNNN.tar.bz2

This will pull out the 'spec' from from the source package, 
which hopefully will be up to date in correspondance with the
package version number NNNNN.

You will then be able to install ASCEND using something like

  rpm -i ~/rpm/ascend-NNNNN-0.jdpipe.i386.rpm

Debian/Unbuntu users should find that they can create a usable
.deb package using the tool 'alien'. We haven't got native
support for the generation of .deb packages at this stage.

NOTE: occasionally the 'ascend.spec' file may need to be updated
if changes have been made to the 'ascend.spec.in' file. Check
the implementation details in the SConstruct file.
