                           UNIX Installation
========================================================================

    These are the instructions for building and installing release 0.9
of the ASCEND IV mathematical modeling environment on a UNIX system.
For Windows, you can download precompiled binaries from our web site:
    http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ascend/

Executive summary version
=========================

    If your system meets the requirements 2 through 5 below, and if
all those pieces lists are installed in the usual places
(/usr/local,/usr/bin/,/usr/lang, etc) you can probably build ASCEND by
typing at the unix prompt (%):
        % ./configure
        % cd ascend4   <--- remember to `cd'
        % make
        % bin/ascend4  <--- runs the program if make doesn't die.

    When ASCEND starts, you will see a lot of startup messages, and
finally you should see something like:
        Reading utilities
        Interface Loaded.
        
        -----------------------------------
        User data directory is /usr0/ballan/ascdata
        -----------------------------------

    If the above does not work, you'll need to 
        % make distclean
in the ascend4 directory, then work through the detailed instructions
contained in this file.

    Otherwise, after you've used ASCEND a little bit without
experiencing any run-time problems, you can boost its performance by
building an optimized version:
        % cd ascend4
        % make distclean
        % cd ..
        % ./configure --enable-optimization
        % cd ascend4
        % make
        % bin/ascend4  

    In fact, if you're a trusting soul and are *sure* Tk, F77, etc are
all installed properly, you can use --enable-optimization from the
beginning.

Requirements
============

    To build and run ASCEND, you need
    1.  Some flavor of UNIX.  This release of ASCEND has been built on
        the following platforms:
        - DEC Alpha running OSF/Digital Unix 3.2, 4.0
        - HP9000/700 running HP-UX 9.05, 10.20
        - IBM PowerPC running AIX 3.2, 4.2
        - Intel x86 running RedHat Linux 4.2, 5.2, 6.1
        - Intel x86 running NetBSD 1.1
        - SGI Indy running Irix 6.2
        - Sun Sparc running SunOS 4.1.x
        - Sun Sparc running Solaris 2.5
    2.  An ANSI-C compiler and C libraries that support ANSI C.
    3.  X11.  This release of ASCEND has only been built on X11r6.
    4.  Tcl/Tk 8.0.5 built and installed on your system.  The official
        Tcl/Tk 8.0 web site is off of the Scriptics Home Page:
            http://www.scriptics.com/
        To download Tcl/Tk 8.0 or patches, visit
            http://www.scriptics.com/download/8.0.html
        Tcl/Tk 8.1 is still an alpha release, and we have not tested
        ASCEND with that preliminary release of Tcl/Tk 8.1.
    5.  Tktable v2.5 built and installed on your system, which is
        available from the ASCEND web site and from
            http://www.hobbs.wservice.com/tcl/capp/tkTable
        or indirectly from
            ftp://ftp.cs.uoregon.edu/pub/tcl/tkTable/tkTable1.80.tar.gz
            http://www.scriptics.com in the 
        Resources / Extensions section.
    6.  yacc or bison.
    Recommend (but not required) tools are
    7.  The flex lexer, version 2.4.1 or later.
    8.  A FORTRAN compiler (You can build ASCEND without a FORTRAN
        compiler, but you may lose some functionality.  See below.)
    9.  xgraph, a graphing program; available from the ASCEND web site.

    ASCEND comes with a `configure' script to help you build ASCEND on
your favorite platform.  However, the configure script is not perfect
and UNIX systems vary widely, so take some time to read through this
file to see what you must do to have ASCEND successfully build on your
machine.

    The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the ASCEND
source tree and a `ConfigAscend' file in the ascend4 directory.  Also,
it creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run in the future
to recreate the current configuration of Makefiles, and a file
`config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for debugging
`configure').

    The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.  The
`configure.in' that comes with ASCEND was designed to use version 2.12
of `autoconf'. 2.13 is known not to work with configure.in.

    The following instructions assume you have down loaded the files
        ascend4-0.9.tar.Z
        tkTable2.5.tar.gz
from the ASCEND web site into the directory where you plan to build
ASCEND; we'll call that directory BUILD_DIR.
    These instructions also assume you have down loaded the files
        tcl8.0.5.tar.gz
        tk8.0.5.tar.gz
from http://www.scriptic.com into the directory where you plan to build
ASCEND, OR that you work on a system where tcl/tk 8.0.5 is installed,
    such as Redhat Linux 6.x or late 5.x.
    Unpacking all the above files in the build directory creates the directories
        ascendiv-0.9/
        tcl8.0.5/
        tk8.0.5/
        Tktable2.5/

    The simplest way to compile this package is:

    1.  Build and install Tcl v8.0.5.  If Tcl v8.0.5 is already
        installed, go to the next step; otherwise obtain the Tcl v8.0.5
        distribution, unpack it, and build it following the directions
        in the distribution.  A summary of the steps to build Tcl are:
      1a. `cd' into the `tcl8.0/unix' directory.
      1b. Type `./configure' to configure Tcl's Makefile.  If you want
          to install Tcl in a directory other than `/usr/local', pass
          that directory in the `--prefix' argument to `configure'.  For
          example:
                ./configure --prefix=/full/install/path
          If you do not plan to install ASCEND, a reasonable value for
          the `--prefix' option is the ascend4 directory in the ASCEND
          distribution, i.e.,
                ./configure --prefix=BUILD_DIR/ascendiv-0.9/ascend4
      1c. Type `make' to build Tcl.
      1d. Type `make test' to test Tcl (optional).
      1e. Type `make install' to install Tcl into the directory you
          specified in the `--prefix' argument.  If you do not want to
          install the man pages, issue the command
                make install-binaries install-libraries
          to install only the binaries, the header file, and the *.tcl
          files.
      1f. Do NOT `make clean' until after you have made the Tk library.
      1g. If you run into problems building Tcl, please consult the Tcl
          distribution.

    2.  Build and install Tk v8.0.5.  If Tk v8.0.5 is already installed,
        go to the next step; otherwise obtain the Tk v8.0.5
        distribution, unpack it, and build it following the directions
        in the distribution.  A summary of the steps to build Tk are:
      2a. `cd' into the `tk8.0/unix' directory.
      2b. Type `./configure' to configure Tk's Makefile.  You should use
          the same value for `--prefix' here as you did when building
          Tcl.
      2c. Type `make' to build Tk.
      2d. Type `make test' to test Tk (optional).
      2e. Type `make install' to install Tk into the directory you
          specified with the `--prefix' argument.  If you do not want to
          install the man pages, issue the command
                make install-binaries install-libraries
          to install only the binaries, the header file, and the *.tcl
          files.
      2f. You can now `make clean' to remove the object files, library,
          and executable.  You can also `cd' into the `tcl8.0/unix'
          directory and `make clean' there.
      2g. If you run into problems building Tk, please consult the Tk
          distribution.

    3.  Build and install TkTable v2.5.  If TkTable v2.5 is already
        installed, go to the next step; otherwise obtain the TkTable
        v2.5 distribution, unpack it, and build it following the
        directions in the distribution, except as noted below.  A summarya
        of the steps to build TkTable are:
      3a. `cd' into the `Tktable2.5/src' directory.
      3b. Type `./configure' to configure TkTable's Makefile.  You
          should use the same value for `--prefix' here as you did when
          building Tcl and Tk. If you are using a stock redhat linux where
          tcl/tk are installed in /usr instead of /usr/local, type
          `./configure  --prefix=/usr --with-tcl=/usr/lib --with-tk=/usr/lib'
      3c. Type `make clean; make' to build TkTable.
      3d. Type `make install' to install TkTable into the directory you
          specified with the `--prefix' argument. You may need to su to root.
      3e. You can now `make clean' to remove the object files, and
          library.
      3f. If you run into problems building TkTable, please consult the
          TkTable distribution.

    4.  `cd' to the `ascendiv-0.9' directory and type `./configure' to
        configure ASCEND for your system.  If you're using `csh' on an
        old version of System V, you might need to type `sh ./configure'
        instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure'
        itself.

        Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
        messages telling which features it is checking for.

        See below for arguments to pass to `configure' and for
        explanations of the and error messages `configure' may produce.
 
    5.  `cd' into the `ascend4' directory and type `make'.  This will
        build any FORTRAN libraries that `configure' didn't find
        (assuming `configure' found a FORTRAN compiler) before it builds
        ASCEND.

    6.  Once `make' successfully completes, typing `bin/ascend4' should
        start ASCEND.  Note that your `DISPLAY' environment variable
        will need to be set to run ASCEND.

        In the `Script' window you will see the License and Warranty for
        ASCEND.  Please read it.

    7.  If you have built ASCEND for your personal use, you can continue
        to run ASCEND from the build directory.  If you want to install
        ASCEND elsewhere so that others may use it or to free disk
        space, type `make install' which will install the ascend binary
        (ascend4), the ASCEND tcl support files (found in the TK
        directory), and the ASCEND models (found in the models
        directory).

    8.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
        source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove
        the files that `configure' created (so you can compile the
        package for a different kind of computer), type
        `make distclean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

    Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
      CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
      env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

    Some systems (notably newer egcs-based systems) require a little
manual intervention to find the right f77 support library. You may need
to give configure the full path for libf2c/libg2c depending on what you
have installed. This can happen even if configure found f77/g77 ok.
For additional help with FORTRAN, see section "Warnings and Errors 
Generated by Configure." You may also need to set (for the build only)
the environment variable CC with the value so that configure picks up
the C compiler that matches your f77.

Warnings and Errors Generated by Configure
==========================================

    Most of the time `configure' will work properly and no intervention
is needed.  We have developed `configure' to work around common
problems, in which case it prints a warning and goes on.  These common
problems include:

    * You do not have a recent version of the `flex' lexer.
      In this case, `configure' will set up the Makefiles to use
      pregenerated C files instead of running `flex' on the input files
      ascend4/compiler/scanner.l and ascend4/interface/typelex.l.  If
      you have `flex' version 2.4.1 or newer and `configure' cannot find
      it, set the `LEX' environment variable to the full path of your
      `flex' program and run `configure' again.

    * You do not have a FORTRAN77 compiler.
      For this case, `configure' disables use of the LSODE integrator,
      so you will not be able to integrate with ASCEND.  If you have a
      Fortran compiler that `configure' is not finding, re-run
      `configure' with the option --with-fortran=COMPILER,LIBRARIES
      where COMPILER is your Fortran compiler and LIBRARIES are any
      libraries it needs.  For example, under SunOS:
        configure --with-fortran='/usr/lang/f77,-L/usr/lang/lib -lF77 -lM77'
      If you have GNU Fortran compiler installed as `g77', configure
      should do the right thing.  If you have it installed as `f77',
      configure may become confused because it look for the wrong set of
      libraries.  In this case, run configure with the argument
        configure --with-fortran='g77,-lf2c'
      If you have an old redhat f77 or f2c, you may want something like:
        configure \
--with-fortran='f77,-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.90.29 -lf2c'

    * Cannot find CONOPT library nor source code.
      CONOPT is proprietary, so we cannot distribute it, but we do
      distribute an interface to it.  To build with CONOPT, run
      `configure' with the option --with-conopt=CONOPTLIB where
      CONOPTLIB is the location of your CONOPT library.  For example:
        configure --with-conopt=/export/conopt/lib/libconsub.a

    There are problems which `configure' lists as fatal errors because
these problems prevent you from building ASCEND.  Those problems are:

    * Cannot find ANSI C compiler.
      We have written ASCEND in ANSI C; you'll need a compiler that
      understands ANSI C and C libraries that implement ANSI C features
      in order to build ASCEND.  If you have an ANSI compiler that
      `configure' is not finding, set the `CC' environment variable to
      its location and run configure again.  If you still get the error,
      please make sure your compiler understands ANSI C and send us mail
      so we can fix `configure'.  Note that `gcc' understands ANSI C, so
      run `configure' with the `--enable-gcc' argument which allows
      `configure' the search for `gcc'.  Also note when using `gcc'
      under SunOS 4.1.x the link phase will fail, since the standard
      SunOS 4.1.x setup does not provide ANSI C libraries.

    * Cannot find compatible Tcl/Tk library or header.
      ASCEND needs Tcl v8.0 and Tk v8.0 compatible library files and
      header files.  If you have built and installed Tcl and Tk 8.0 and
      `configure' cannot find them, run configure again with the
      arguments `--with-tcl=TCL_LIB,TCL_HEADER' where TCL_LIB is the
      location of the Tcl library, and TCL_HEADER is the location of the
      Tcl header file; a similar `--with-tk' argument exists.  For
      example,
        configure --with-tcl='-L/usr/local/lib -ltcl,/usr/local/include/tcl.h' \
                  --with-tk='-L/usr/local/lib -ltk,/usr/local/include/tk.h'


ASCEND Specific Options for Configure
=====================================

    `configure' accepts several options.  Type `configure --help' for a
full list.  Options of particular interest when building ASCEND are:
    --enable-gcc
        By default, `configure' uses the environment variable `CC', then
        `cc', `c89', `xlf', and `acc' when searching for an ANSI C
        compiler. This option tells `configure' to use the environment
        variable `CC', next to look for `gcc', and then to consider the
        other compilers as listed above when it is trying to locate an
        ANSI C compiler.
    --enable-optimization
        By default, `configure' sets `CFLAGS' such that the C files are
        built with debugging information (-g).  This option turns off
        debugging and turns on optimization and NDEBUG (-O -DNDEBUG=1).
    --without-models
        If `configure' finds the `models' source directory, it will
        descend into it and create Makefiles. With this option, 
        `configure' does not create Makefiles in the `models' directory.
        If there is no `models' source directory, this option has no
        effect.  The only purpose for the Makefiles in the `models'
        directory is to allow the `make install' target to work.
    --without-TK
        Same as the `--without-models' option except is applies to the
        `TK' subdirectory.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

    You can compile ASCEND for more than one kind of computer at
the same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in
their own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the source
code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

    If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

    By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

    You can specify separate installation prefixes for architecture-
specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you give
`configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use PATH
as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.  Documentation and
other data files will still use the regular prefix.

    In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

    Note that you should use the final `apparent' resting place of the
files as the arguments to `--prefix' and `--exec_prefix' since these
options often set variables that get compiled into the binaries.  When
you actually do `make install' to install the program, pass the `actual'
resting place on the `make' line.  For example, if ascend appears to
live in /usr/local/bin/ascend but that is actually a symbolic link to
/afs/cs/local/ascend/@sys/omega/bin/ascend, you should:
        configure --prefix=/usr/local
        make
        make install prefix=/afs/cs/local/ascend/@sys/omega

Optional Features
=================

    For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

    There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config/config.sub' for the possible values of each field.
If `config/config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package
doesn't need to know the host type.

Sharing Defaults
================

    If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

    `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help'
    Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
    Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
    Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
    `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
    Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
    script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
