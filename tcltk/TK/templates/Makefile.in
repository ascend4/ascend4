#  This file contains two lists used for installing ASCEND:
#
#    INSTALL_SUBDIR_LIST -- lists the subdirectories of this directory
#                           which contain files to be installed
#
#    INSTALL_FILE_LIST -- lists the files that are to be installed
#                         when ASCEND is installed.

#  Running `make install' further up the directory tree will cause
#  make to descend into this directory and install the listed file.
#  The location of the RULES_FILE will be passed to `make'.
