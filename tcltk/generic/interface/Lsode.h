/** @file
 *  Lsode Integrator.
 *  <pre>
 *  NOTE:         The macro DOTIME is defined inside Lsode.c.
 *                If its value is TRUE, we spew all sorts of time junk.
 *                If FALSE we are quiet. Default for this macro is FALSE.
 *
 *  Requires      #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *                #include "solver/slv_client.h"
 *                #include "interface/Integrators.h"
