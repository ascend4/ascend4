extern int Asc_BrowFindTypeCmd(ClientData cdata, Tcl_Interp *interp,

/**<
 *  Implementation of find by type. More will be said later.
 *  <pre>
 *  Old Usage : __brow_find_type type attribute ?value?
 *  New usage:
 *  __brow_find_type <current,search> <typename> [attr [loval [hival]]]
 *
 *  The Tcl window corresponding to this function has 4 boxes to fill.
 *  Type, Atributtes, Low Value and High Value.
 *
 *  There is nothing about this function from Kirk. After looking trough
 *  the code, I can make the following remarks.
 *
 *  1) The default context for finding by type is the instance currently
 *      highlighted.
 *  2) Obviously, the type one wants to find has to be provided in the first
 *      box of the Tcl window.
 *  3) For each type of instance, there exists a filtering function
 *      which will perform according to the values given in the other
 *      3 boxes. When the type one provides is a Model or an
 *      array, the filtering functions of these types do nothing.
 *  4) The box Attributes correponds to the children of the type
 *      selected. So, for example, "included" is a valid attribute of
 *      a relation.
 *  5) When the Attribute is provided, the value of the
 *      attribute should also be provided in the box "Low Value", if
 *      applicable. For example, for the attribute "included" a valid
 *      value is TRUE (or FALSE). In this way, one can ask for
 *      specific relations among the total list.
 *  6) There are two special attributes, which do not correpond to
 *      children of an instance: "VALUE" and "UNDEFINED".
 *      i)For example, if the type requested is a boolean, we can
 *        use the attribute VALUE for finding booleans with a particular
 *        value. The value selected should be provided in the box "Lower
 *        Value". This capability can be used for boolean, integer,
 *        symbol, relation, and logic_relation.
 *        Similarly, "UNDEFINED" is used when the value of
 *        a symbol, integer or real has not been defined. In that case
 *        the last two boxes are left empty.
 *     ii)Specifically for the type "relation", the Attribute "VALUE" is
 *        associated with the residual of the relation. We can specify
 *        the range of the residuals we are interesting in, by using the
 *        last two boxes.
 *
 *        My modification to this function is an extension to deal with
 *        logical relations, and whens. For conditional relations I did
 *        nothing. They will show up in the list of relations. For whens,
 *        I do the same as the case of models and arrays. For Logrelations,
 *        the filtering can be done in terms of the logical residual.
 *        Note that for this case, Feasibles Lower Value for the attribute
 *        "VALUE" are  "TRUE" and "FALSE".
 *
