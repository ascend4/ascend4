 *
 *  By "associated" I mean:
 *
 *   -# If the instance is integer, symbol or boolean, this instance
 *      may be part of the list of variables of one/several WHEN statements.
 *      If this is the case, the list of "associated" WHENs will be send to
 *      the Tcl interpreter.
 *
 *   -# If the instance is a relation, the list of WHENs which include
 *      that relation in some CASE, will be send to the interpreter.
 *      When the instance is a Model or a WHEN, the previous function
 *      Asc_BrowWriteWhenListCmd is used instead.
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: For the case of relations, this function works if the
 *  WHEN include the equation explicitly. It will not work if the
 *  WHEN inlcude the equation implicitly by including the model which
 *  contains the relation.<br><br>
