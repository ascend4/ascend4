/**< 
 *  Contents:     Memory module
 *
 *  Authors:      Karl Westerberg
 *                Benjamin Andrew Allan
 *
 *  Dates:        06/90 - original version
 *                08/94 - cleanup with bzero, bcopy, and corrected casting.
 *                        BAA, JJZ
 *                05/95 - add nearly generic element allocation routines.
 *                        BAA
 *
 *  Description:  It is convenient for pointers and ints to be the same
 *                size, and most C compilers support this.  However for
 *                many machines (particularly ones with 16-bit words),
 *                there is more RAM available than can be accessed by a
 *                single int, so standard C pointers may only be able to
 *                point to a limited region of memory.  The matter is
 *                further complicated by the fact that the pointer to
 *                address conversion rules may be different for pointers
 *                to functions (code) than for pointers to other objects
 *                (data).  This module attempts to partially circumvent
 *                these obstacles, by allowing the user to address memory
 *                with long ints.
 *
 *                As you can see, the above was written in the bad old
 *                days pre-ANSI/STDC.
 *                This file now serves to isolate bzero, bcopy, etc
 *                from solver code should they become nonstandard.
 *
 *                The generic element memory manager is yet another
 *                implementation of a fixed byte size malloc system
 *                that is more efficient than most standard mallocs. This
 *                is possible because we make the fixed size assumption.
 *                The idea is clearly not original.
 *                For best results, you must understand your memory
 *                usage pattern and tune the mem_create_store parameters
 *                accordingly.

/***************************************************************************\
 The following definitions provide a generic and reasonably efficient memory
 allocation system for situations where many many objects of the same size
 need to be "allocated and deallocated" rapidly and stored efficiently:
 that is to say when normal malloc is too slow and expensive.
 This scheme does not play reference count games. Instead any elements that
 have been created and then used and subsequently "freed" go on a list
 and are handed out again at the next opportunity. The list is run LIFO.
 The list is associated with the mem_store_t.
 
 There is one restriction on the elements: they will be a multiple of the
 size of a pointer, even if you specify otherwise. If this is too large,
 write your own allocator.
 There is the implicit restriction on a store that it must contain
 no more than MAXINT elements. If this is too small, write your own allocator.

 Note for the intelligent:
 If you specify an element size that is not a nice multiple of your machine
 word length, you are *very* likely to get data alignment (bus) errors.
 E.g., if your element is not a convenient multiple of sizeof(double) in size,
 double data are likely to die.

 The allocation scheme looks like so:
  [struct mem_store_header | ]
         __________________|
        |
        V
  pool  _____________________________________________________
        | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b | b |
        -----------------------------------------------------
  where each b is a pointer to an array of size 'width' of elements.

 The size characteristics of this scheme are tunable at run time so that
 it can be scaled well when the number of elements and likely amount
 of expansion required are known.

 *  ms = mem_create_store(length, width, eltsize, deltalen, deltapool);
 *  mem_store_t ms;
 *  int length,width,deltalen,deltapool;
 *  size_t eltsize;
 *
 *  Returns a mem_store_t which can be used in future. The mem_store_t
 *  contains all the necessary accounting information, but in particular
 *  the eltsize is fixed at creation. All elements requested from ms will be
 *  pointers to eltsize bytes of memory.
 *  Returns NULL if a store of the requested length*width*eltsize
 *  cannot be initially allocated.
 * 
 *  The user may request more than length*width elements from the store:
 *  this will cause it to grow. It will grow (internally) in chunks of
 *  deltalen*width elements. The pool vector above grows in chunks of 
 *  deltapool, the extra pointers in it being NULL until needed.
 *
 *  Info for tuning purposes:
 *
 *  For maximum efficiency, eltsize should be an integer
 *  multiple of sizeof(void *). If it is not, elts will be padded
 *  so that this is the case. This is to avoid pointer data misalignment.
 *  This restriction may or may not help avoid alignment problems with
 *  items inside the user's element structure.
 *
 *  Width should (for some architectures) be such that 
 *  width*eltsize = 2^n - 32 for some n fairly large (heuristic: n= 9..13).
 *  Widths that are too large may be prone to causing excess page faults,
 *  though the process cpu time reported by the clock() can be much
 *  better for extremely large sizes.
 *  Widths that are too small will result in an excessive number of pool
 *  expansions which may severely limit performance on some VM systems.
 *  See deltapool below about pool expansions.
 *  If you know something about the page size of your architecture, fiddling
 *  with width may reduce help you reduce page fault or cache miss count in
 *  some uses.
 *
 *  Deltalen is the number of additional pointers in the pool that will be
 *  allocated when more elements are needed than are available internally,
 *  as already noted. 
 *
 *  Deltapool is the size change of the pool array described above: it should
 *  be as large as you are willing to tolerate. The pool array starts out
 *  completely filled (all pointers allocated). When the pool needs more
 *  pointers it gets them in chunks of at least deltapool. These additional
 *  pointers will not automatically have elements allocated to them; rather,
 *  they will be initialized to NULL and filled in only as the chunks of
 *  deltalen*width elements are required.

 *  Ellist should point to an array with enough space for len pointers.
 *  Returns NULL in ellist[0] iff store growth is required and the operating
