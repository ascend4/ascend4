 *
 *  Description:  This module is responsible for primitive manipulation
 *                of sets of integers (using a binary bit map technique).
 *                In particular, the set variables have domain
 *                {k in N | k < n}, where n is a fixed constant, which
 *                we will call the (bit-)size of the set.  The sets are
 *                actually arrays of unsigned of appropriate length,
 *                and pointers to such arrays can actually be used in
 *                place of pointers returned by set_create() (although
 *                one must be careful not to destroy such sets with
 *                set_destroy()).
