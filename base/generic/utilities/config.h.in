	DUAL SUPPORT FOR BOTH AUTOTOOLS AND SCONS

	When I add a new flag to SCons, I will use the form (replace \ by /):
		
		\* #define FLAGNAME @FLAGNAME@ *\

	Using SCons, I can uncomment these lines using text-substitution.
	If you want to add support for these flags in your autotools build
	you just need to uncomment these lines; no changes to the SCons build
	will be necessary (as it will also hunt for @FLAGNAME@ in its
	text-subst.

	This variable determines how ASCEND goes about finding all its stuff at runtime,
	assuming the ASCENDDIST environment variable is *not* present.

	ASCENDDIST is where Python, Tcl/Tk and model scripts, as well as graphics etc are
	kept in the filesystem. Normally it is expected that ASCEND should be able to
	know or work out this location itself.

	If ASC_ABSOLUTE_PATHS is defined, ASCEND will used a fixed absolute path to locate
	its data files. This is the standard Red Hat and Debian system, in which
	binaries are typically located in /usr/bin but related non-exe files are located
	in /usr/share/appname/. See ASC_DATADIR in this case.

	If not defined, ASCEND will locate its data files using a relative path based on
	the location of the running executable. See ASC_DISTDIR_REL_BIN. This is the
	'application folder' style made popular on early Macs, and also favoured by CMU.

	For a discussion of this, see
	http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/03/174249

	At present, the only place this has any effect is in the Tcl/Tk
	interface, in Driver.c's choices for default values of non-specified
	environment variables. @TODO migrate this to Python as well.

	SCons will uncomment the #define line if required.
	Doing it this (hacky) way so as not to mess up autoconf.

	Note: do not use ASC_ABSOLUTE_PATHS on Windows. Absolute paths mess up the
	ability of the installer to relocate files at install-time.
