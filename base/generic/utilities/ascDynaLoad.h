/* ChangeLog
 * Small changes made by Michael Moore (mdm@cis.ohio-state.edu)
 * December 24th, 1993.
 * The tcl sections ripped out by Kirk Abbott (ka0p@edrc.cmu.edu)
 * September 3rd, 1994.
 * To date the architectures supported are:
 * sun
 * osf,
 * solaris,
 * hpux
 * sgi
 * ultrix
 * possibly aix if we plunder it from tcl8
 *
 * Added Asc_DynamicUnLoad. Ben Allan (ballan@cs.cmu.edu) Jan 1998.
 * Your mileage may vary.
 * UnLoad alleged for sun, hp, sgi, and alpha/osf. It probably works
 * only as well as their dlclose and shl_unload do.
