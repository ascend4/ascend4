/** @file
 *  Ascend Environment Variable Imitation.
 *
 *  This file exists because win32, among others, can't keep their
 *  POSIX compliance up. In particular, getting and setting
 *  environment vars is exceedingly unreliable.
 *  This file implements a general way to store and fetch multiple
 *  paths.
 *  <pre>
 *  Requires:
 *         #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *
 *  Linking against this header requires linking optionally
 *  (depending on defines in list.h and the makefile):
 *      ascmalloc.o,
 *      pool.o,
 *  and definitely
 *      list.o
 *      ascPanic.o
 *      ascEnvVar.o
 *  </pre>
