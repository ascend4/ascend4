 *  This file is part of the Ascend Programming System.
 *  This file standardizes the handling of signals because some OS
 *  reset signals to SIG_DFL when a trap goes off while others
 *  process the signal but leave the trapping function in place.
 *  We want the second behavior and this gives it to us.

/**<
 *  <!--  Asc_SignalTrap(sigval);                                       -->
 *  This is the trap that should be used for most applications in
 *  ASCEND. It calls longjmp(g_SIG_env,sigval)
 *  where SIG is one of fpe, seg, int as listed above.
 *  Note that g_SIG_env is global, so you can't nest calls to
 *  setjmp where both use this trap function.
 *
 *  Trivial Example:
 *  <pre>
 *     Asc_SignalHandlerPush(SIGFPE,Asc_SignalTrap);
 *     if (setjmp(g_fpe_env)==0) {
 *       y = sqrt(x);
 *     } else {
 *       y = sqrt(-x);
 *     }
 *     Asc_SignHandlerPop(SIGFPE,Asc_SignalTrap);
 *  
 *  For x < 0 the else is called because setjmp returns nonzero
 *  when the body of the 'if' signals range error.
 *  </pre>
 *  This is one of the really odd things in C; if x > 0
 *  then sqrt is ok and setjmp returns 1.
 *  Remember always to use push and pop. You can
 *  write an alternate function to use instead of
 *  AscSignalTrap if need be.
 *  SIGFPE, SIGINT, SIGSEGV are understood.<br><br>
 *
 *  Warning: setjmp is expensive if called inside a fast loop.

 * This function reinstalls the most recent signal handlers this module
 * has been informed of. This should be called after every
 * trapped exception and at any other time when the status of
 * exception handlers may have become not well defined.
 * The most recently pushed handler is installed for each supported
 * signal. This call is not particularly cheap if it does the
 * reinstallation.<br><br>
 *
 * This module tests on startup for whether the OS reverts to
 * SIG_DFL when a trap function is called. If it does NOT then
 * this function will simply return unless force != 0. You don't
 * want to call this function with force == 1 normally, but when
 * using gdb or another debugger which intercepts and screws up
 * signals, applying force (manually) ensures that the signals
 * get reinstalled.

 * There is a maximum stack limit, so returns 1 if limit exceeded.
 * Returns -1 if stack of signal requested does not exist.
 * Pushing a NULL handler func does NOT change anything at all.
 * On a successful return, the handler has been installed and will
 * remain installed until a Asc_SignalHandlerPop or another push.
 * (Remain installed part is TRUE only if Asc_SignalRecover is used
 * properly after every longjmp.)

 * installs the new last trap. Sideeffects: reinstalls all other
 * currently pushed traps, also.
 * If called with func != NULL, checks that the trap popped is the
 * same as func and returns nonzero if it is not.
 * If stack is empty, returns nonzero.
