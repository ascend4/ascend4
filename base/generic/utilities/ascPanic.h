 *  This function prints the arguments "args" using the format string
 *  "format" to the ASCERR file handle.  The first line of the panic
 *  message will print ``ASCEND PANIC!! in function'' if the argument
 *  "function" is not NULL.  If ASCERR has not been initialized to a
 *  valid file pointer, the message will not be printed.  Either way,
 *  if an panic output file location has been specified with the 
 *  Asc_PanicSetOutfile() function, the panic message is also stored 
 *  there.  Under Windows, we also pop up a MessageBox containing the 
 *  message.  Finally, we exit the program with the status "status".
 *
 *  Side Effects: Exits the program.
