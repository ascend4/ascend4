 * each line written is indented by indent characters.
 * this function is not very bright, but works on nonpathological
 * input ok. long words are not broken.
 * width does not include the indent, so pls(f,s,70,2) -> 72 char lines.

 * Note that \n and \t count as a character when determining line length,
 * so you won't get perfect formatting. If you want perfect formatting,
 * fix it. How big is a tab? In particular, \n will cause a missing
