/** @file
 *  Table Module.
 *
 *  Many hash tables are used throughout the implementation of a compiler
 *  and/or interpreter. This module (in the spirit of the list module)
 *  attempts to provide a generic table implementation, based on the classic
 *  *bucket and chains* for resolving collisions. Nothing fancy is done,
 *  except that we cache a ptr to the last thing found, so that access to
 *  it if required is fast. We append the new element to the front of the
 *  chain. The hashpjw algorithm is used.<br><br>
 *
 *  This module is appropriate for hash tables keyed with arbitrary strings.
 *  It is not appropriate for use with symbol table entry keys.
 *  <pre>
 *  Requires:
 *        #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *  </pre>
