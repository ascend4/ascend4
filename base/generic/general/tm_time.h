/** @file

 *  Contents:     Time module
 *
 *  Authors:      Karl Westerberg
 *                Joseph Zaher
 *
 *  Dates:        06/90 - original version
 *                08/93 - removed CLOCKS_PER_SECOND which should be
 *                        provided by the standard library, eliminated
 *                        tm_TPS and changed tm_run_time() and
 *                        tm_cpu_time() to return number of seconds
 *                06/94 - eliminated cute calendar functions for full
 *                        ANSI compatibility.
 *
 *  Description:  Provide a function to monitor elapsed time during the
 *                course of execution of a program and standard ANSI
 *                primitives for performing calendar calculations.
 *
 *  Apology:      We apologize for the existence of this file and for
 * 		            its name being the same as an ANSI C header which is not
 *		            consistently available, unfortunately. We really
 *		            ought not to need this header.
 *
 *  Requires:     #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *  </pre>
