/** @file
 *  Binary tokens implementation for real relation instances.
 *
 *  Note that this header and btprolog.h are a pair.
 *  btprolog exists to make the C compiler job simpler -
 *  we don't want it to know about struct Instance when
 *  building code because we may not have the compiler
 *  directory available. btprolog.h is installed with
 *  the ascend binaries or scripts.
 *  <pre>
 *  When #including bintoken.h, make sure these files are #included first:
 *         #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *         #include "instance_enum.h"
 *  </pre>
