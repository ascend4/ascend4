/** @file
 *  Ascend Instance Tree TmpNum functions.
 *
 *  About tmp numbers. These are a scratch long for use of transient
 *  clients, including the compiler itself. The tmp num should not be
 *  expected to remain the same above the scope of the function in
 *  which it is set. In particular, all clients are free to stomp on
 *  it at will so don't count on it holding a value you set unless you
 *  know that none of your subroutines will mess with it before you
 *  need it.
 *
 *  Note that NULL instances have a tmpnum of LONG_MAX, if anyone
 *  is dumb enough to ask. This will generally cause fallout
 *  elsewhere.
 *  <pre>
 *  When #including tmpnum.h, make sure these files are #included first:
 *         #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *         #include "instance_enum.h"
 *  </pre>
