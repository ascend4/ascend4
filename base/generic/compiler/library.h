	Type Definition Library.

	Implements a type definition library for use by the ASCEND compiler.
	Each type encountered during parsing is converted to a TypeDescription
	and stored in the main type library maintained by this module.
	The type library will only maintain one definition for a given type
	name.  The library will complain if you try to add two types with the
	same name unless it happens when reloading a module.

	Requires:

	#include "compiler/compiler.h"
	#include "compiler/type_desc.h"
	#include "compiler/module.h"
	#include "general/list.h"
