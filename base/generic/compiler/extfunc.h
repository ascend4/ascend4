	External Functions Module.

	This module implements the ExternalFunc structure referenced by the
	ExtCallNode structure, and allows syntax for black box and glass box
	relations to be implemented, as well as	external method calls.

	The ExternalFunc structure stores the number of input and output parameters
	as well as 'help' string and 'name' string' for each of these 'calls'.

	@todo Complete documentation of compiler/extfunc.h.
