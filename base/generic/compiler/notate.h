	@file
	This file defines and manages a little (we hope)
	database system for storing NOTES in-core in a variety
	of quickly accessible ways.

	If scale gets to be an issue, this could become a wrapper
	for a real database someday.

	This implementation is not optimized for anything -- the
	intent here is to learn if it can be done at all.
