/*
 *  Notes on the instance type scheme.
 *      Ben Allan, Feb. 1996.
 *  We have three types of 'scalar data' instances:
 *  *_INST, *_ATOM_INST, and *_CONSTANT_INST,
 *  where * is REAL, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, SYMBOL and SET.
 *  (Sets are a little weird and should perhaps not be grouped in *.)
 *  The word Atom is used a little loosely in naming of functions in
 *  this file. Many places it implies any of these types, but in some
 *  it implies exclusively *_ATOM_INST types.
 *     READ YOUR HEADERS CAREFULLY.
 *  Atoms are the 'variables' in the ASCEND language.
 *  Constants are the 'structural variables' and 'real constants'.
 *  *_INST are the children of Atoms.
 *  Constants do not have children and cannot be children of Atoms.
 *  Constants may be refined up until they are actually assigned
 *  a value (and in the case of reals a dimensionality).
 *  Constants in a clique (bad style, imho) all have the same value/dims:
 *  assigning one assigns them all. ATS is usually a better style.
 *
 *  Future work:
 *  LIST replaces SET in the Atom group; the atomic SET becoming the
 *  constant SET.
 *  REAL_ATOM_INST becomes the parametric reals of a model and
 *  a new SOLVER_ATOM_INST becomes the real variables of a model.
