/**< 
 * Notes on the structure implemented for ASCEND arrays.
 *
 * ASCEND arrays are 'associative arrays.' That is they are
 * not sequential in memory, rather they are accessed by
 * names of the elements. So there really isn't a difference
 * between a dense rectangular array and a sparse array except
 * it is algorithmically easier to construct the dense array.
 *
 * E.G.
 * a[1..2]['a','f'] IS_A foo;
 *  yields an internal data structure (a, uai1 and uai1
 *  are ArrayInstances as described in instance_types.h) like so:
 * a -------------------|-----------------------|    <=== gl_list_t
 *                      V                       V         *childlist.
 *                   ArrayChild{             ArrayChild{
 *                   name.int = 1            name.int = 2
 *             unnamed array inst|}    unnamed array inst|}
 *    /--------------------------/    /------------------/
 *   V                               V
 *   uai1 ------|-------|            uai2 -----|-----|  <=== gl_list_t's
 *              V       V                      V     V
 *            AC       AC                     AC     AC
 *      name.str='a'  name.str='f'      name.str='a'  name.str='f'
 *      inst --\      inst --\          inst --\      inst --\
 *             |             |                 |             |
 *             V             V                 V             V
 *       fooinst       fooinst            fooinst       fooinst
 *
 *  Unnamed array instances actually DO have a compiler generated
 *  internal name, but it is not useful for anything except avoiding
 *  core dumps in routines that assume all insts have names.
 *
 *  Navigating these structures during assembly is
 *  terribly dangerous so all that is handled by this file.
 *
 *  All the indirection in these structures makes interesting tricks
 *  for sparse and dense arrays possible.
 *
 *  One trick in particular,
 *  however, is NOT to be attempted because it plays havoc with the
 *  semantics of the ASCEND language: thou shalt not declare an array
 *  over one set and then later expand it to have more elements.
 *  This would be trivial to implement because the elements exist in
 *  gl_lists, but so far every potential application proposed for it
 *  has been the result of sloppy thinking and/or lazy thinking.
 *  In the end we may find a need for a genuine multidimensional
 *  ListInstance that has much in common with arrays, but such a
 *  creature should be implemented as it's own creature and not a
 *  sloppy graft on top of arrays.
