/** @file
 *  Ascend Instance Array Functions.
 *  <pre>
 *  When #including arrayinst.h, make sure these files are #included first:
 *         #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *         #include "instance_enum.h"
 *         #include "compiler.h"
 *         #include "setvalinst.h"
 *         #include "pool.h"
 *         #include "list.h"
 *
 *  Notes on the structure implemented for ASCEND arrays.
 *
 *  ASCEND arrays are 'associative arrays.' That is they are
 *  not sequential in memory, rather they are accessed by
 *  names of the elements. So there really isn't a difference
 *  between a dense rectangular array and a sparse array except
 *  it is algorithmically easier to construct the dense array.
 *
 *  For example:
 *
 *       a[1..2]['a','f'] IS_A foo;
 *
 *  yields an internal data structure (a, uai1 and uai2
 *  are ArrayInstances as described in instance_types.h) like so:
 *
 *  a -------------------|-----------------------|    <=== gl_list_t
 *                       V                       V         *childlist.
 *                    ArrayChild{             ArrayChild{
 *                    name.int = 1            name.int = 2
 *              unnamed array inst|}    unnamed array inst|}
 *     /--------------------------/    /------------------/
 *    V                               V
 *    uai1 ------|-------|            uai2 -----|-----|  <=== gl_list_t's
 *               V       V                      V     V
 *             AC       AC                     AC     AC
 *       name.str='a'  name.str='f'      name.str='a'  name.str='f'
 *       inst --\      inst --\          inst --\      inst --\
 *              |             |                 |             |
 *              V             V                 V             V
 *        fooinst       fooinst            fooinst       fooinst
 *
 *  Unnamed array instances actually DO have a compiler generated
 *  internal name, but it is not useful for anything except avoiding
 *  core dumps in routines that assume all insts have names.
 *
 *  Navigating these structures during assembly is
 *  terribly dangerous so all that is handled by this file.
 *
 *  All the indirection in these structures makes interesting tricks
 *  for sparse and dense arrays possible.
 *
 *  One trick in particular, however, is NOT to be attempted because
 *  it plays havoc with the semantics of the ASCEND language:
 *  thou shalt not declare an array over one set and then later expand
 *  it to have more elements.  This would be trivial to implement
 *  because the elements exist in gl_lists, but so far every potential
 *  application proposed for it has been the result of sloppy and/or
 *  lazy thinking.  In the end we may find a need for a genuine
 *  multidimensional ListInstance that has much in common with arrays,
 *  but such a creature should be implemented as its own creature and
 *  not a sloppy graft on top of arrays.
 *  </pre>
