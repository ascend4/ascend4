/** @file
 *  This Module Store A Copy of Atom Instances.

 *  Given the amount of time we spend looking for prototypes, we need
 *  to be running distinct prototype libraries for models, atoms, and
 *  possibly constants.
 *  <pre>
 *  When #including prototype.h, make sure these files are #included first:
 *         #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *         #include"instance_enum.h"
 *         #include "compiler.h"
 *  </pre>
