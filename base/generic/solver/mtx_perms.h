 ***  a square matrix. The range reg->row is assumed to represent the
 ***  extreme points of a square region. The caller owns the result and 
 ***  must be deallocate it.
 ***  If the matrix given (or its master) is not assigned, this will
 ***  verify (at some expense) that the diagonal is full and whine
 ***  if not. It will attempt to partition anyway assuming a diagonal.<br><br>
