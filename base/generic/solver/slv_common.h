/** 
 *  Contents:     slv common utilities and definitions

 *  Authors:      Ben Allan
 *                based on the original slv.h by KW and JZ.

 *  Dates:        01/94 - original version
 *  Description:
 *  General C  utility routines for slv/Slv class interfaces. Abstracted from
 *  slvX.c January 1995. Ben Allan.
 *  slv.h is the header for folks on the ASCEND end, and this is the one for
 *  folks on the Slv math end.
 *  Don't protoize this file for ASCEND types other than mtx, vec, and boolean
 *  real64, and int32.
 *  or we'll have you shot. In particular, not var and rel. People
 *  who aren't supposed to know about var and rel include this.
 *
 *  In particular, this header may be used without knowing about the ASCEND
 *  compiler or any of its annoying insanities so long as you drag out
 *  ascmalloc.
 *  This does commit you to being able to stomach the mtx.h file, however,
 *  even if you choose to ignore the contents of mtx.
 *  Several functions, notably the print suite for rel/var names,
 *  assume you are linking against something that does know about
 *  ASCEND instances unless the SLV_INSTANCES flag is set to FALSE.
 * 
 *  The parameters and status struct definitions have been moved here,
 *  being of general interest.

/** 
 *  Every registered client should have a slv_parameters_t somewhere in it.
 *
 *  The following is a list of parameters (those parameters that can be
 *  modified during solve without calling slv_presolve are marked with
 *  "$$$").  It should be noted that some solvers may not be conformable
 *  to some of the parameters.  Default values are subject to change via
 *  experimentation.
 *
 *  output.more_important (default stdout):   $$$
 *  output.less_important (default NULL):     $$$
 *     All output from the solver is written to one of these two files
 *     (except bug messages which are written to stderr).  Common values
 *     are NULL (==> no file) and stdout.  The more important messages
 *     go to output.more_important and less important messages go to
 *     output.less_important.  To shut the solver up, set both files to
 *     NULL.
 *
 *  tolerance.drop         (default 1e-16):
 *  tolerance.pivot        (default 0.1):
 *  tolerance.singular     (default 1e-12):
 *  tolerance.feasible     (default 1e-8):
 *  tolerance.rootfind     (default 1e-12):
 *  tolerance.stationary   (default 1e-8):
 *  tolerance.termination  (default 1e-12):
 *     These define the criterion for selecting pivotable relations,
 *     whether the equations are satisfied, if a local minimum has been
 *     found, or if no further reduction in the augmented lagrange merit
 *     phi can be achieved.
 *   - During jacobian reduction, each equation pivot selected must be
 *     at least a certain fraction given by TOLERANCE.PIVOT of the largest
 *     available.
 *     Also, the largest value in the row must exceed TOLERANCE.SINGULAR
 *     in order to be considered independent. 
 *   - The absolute value of each unscaled equation residual is compared
 *     with TOLERANCE.FEASIBLE in order to determine convergence of the
 *     equality constraints during Newton iteration. 
 *   - The absolute value of each unscaled equation residual is compared
 *     with TOLERANCE.ROOTFIND in order to determine convergence of the
 *     constraint during rootfinding of single equations. 
 *   - Detection of a minimum requires the stationary condition of the
 *     lagrange to be less than TOLERANCE.STATIONARY. 
 *   - If the directional derivative of phi along the negative gradient
 *     direction using the suggested iteration step length falls below
 *     TOLERANCE.TERMINATION, iteration is ceased.
 *   - TOLERANCE.DROP is the smallest number magnitude to be allowed
 *     in the Jacobian matrix during factorization. Default is optimistic.
 *
 *  time_limit (default 30.0):   $$$
 *     This defines the time limit expressed as cpu seconds per block.
 *     If the solver requires more time than this in any given block,
 *     then it will stop.
 *
 *  iteration_limit (default 100):   $$$
 *     This defines the maximum number of iterations attempted in a given
 *     block.  The solver will stop after this many iterations if it fails
 *     to converge.
 *
 *  factor_option (default 0):
 *     This sets the number of the linear factorization to suggest.
 *     This does not map directly to linsol numbering of any sort.
 *     The map is: 0 <==> RANKI, 1 <==> RANKI_JZ, 2+ <==> ?.
 *     The solver is free to ignore this suggestion.
 *     In fact, the specific solver is free to define the meaning of factor
 *     option depending on what linear packages it can talk to.
 *
 *  partition (default TRUE):
 *     Specifies whether or not the system will be partitioned into blocks
 *     or not.  If not, then the system will be considered as one large
 *     block.
 *
 *  ignore_bounds (default FALSE):
 *     Specifies whether or not bounds will be considered during solving.
 *     WARNING: if this flag is set, there will be no guarantees that the
 *     solution will lie in bounds.  Suggested use might be to set this
 *     flag to TRUE, solve, reset this flag to FALSE, and resolve.
 *     More often than not, in fact, ignore bounds will lead to floating
 *     point exceptions, halting the solution process.
 *
 *  rho (default 1.0):
 *     Used as a scalar pre-multiplier of the penalty term quantified by one
 *     half the two norm of the equality constraint residuals in an
 *     augmented lagrange merit function.  
 *
 *  sp.ia/ra/ca/vap (defaults NULL, READ ONLY):
 *     Is a set of pointers to arrays (int/double/(char*)/void*).
 *     The values of the pointers themselves should not be modified,
 *     though the values pointed at may be modified. Note that this is
 *     _direct_ modification and will take effect immediately, not on 
 *     the next call to slv_set_parameters. When the engine gets around
 *     to looking at the values in these arrays is engine dependent.
 *     NULL is the expected value for some or all of these array
 *     pointers, depending on the engine. The sizes of these arrays are
 *     specific to each solver's interface. As being of interest (at
 *     compile time) to both the slvI.c file and the GUI/CLUI, the
 *     sizes of the arrays to be pointed to are part of the slvI.h file.
 *     The implementor of each slvI.c should take care to use as much of
 *     the slv_parameters_t as possible before passing data through the
 *     arrays provided in the sub_parameters. This will make for a
 *     minimal amount of work when adding an engine to the GUI/CLUI.
 *     To further aid reusability/sanity preservation, slvI.h should
 *     be appended with proper defines for subscripting these arrays.
 *
 *  sp.i/r/c/vlen (defaults 0, READ ONLY)
 *     lengths of the sub_parameter arrays.
 *
 *  sp.ia/ra/ca/vanames (defaults NULL, READONLY)
 *     symbolic names for the corresponding entries in ia/ra/ca/vap.
 *
 *  sp.ia/ra/ca/vaexpln (defaults NULL, READONLY)
 *     longer explanations for the corresponding entries in ia/ra/ca/vap.
 *
 *  whose (default 0=>slv0, READ ONLY)
 *     This tells where a parameter set came from, since the default
 *     action of slv_get_parameters is to return a copy of slv0's
 *     parameters if the parameters asked for don't exist because
 *     the solver in question wasn't built/linked.

/** 
 *  The following is a list of statuses and their meanings.  Statuses
 *  cannot be written to, and thus there is no notion of default value.
 *
 *  ok:
 *     Specifies whether or not everything is "ok".  It is a shorthand for
 *     testing all of the other flags.
 *
 *  over_defined:
 *  under_defined:
 *  struct_singular:
 *     Specifies whether the system is over-defined, under-defined, or
 *     structurally singular.  These fields are set by slv_presolve where
 *     the structural analysis is performed.  It should be noted that
 *     over_defined and under_defined are mutually exclusive and both
 *     imply struct_singular, although a system can be structurally
 *     singular without being over-defined or under-defined.
 *
 *  ready_to_solve:
 *     Specifies whether the system is ready to solve.  In other words, is
 *     slv_iterate or slv_solve legal?  This flag is FALSE before
 *     slv_presolve or after the system has converged or the solver has
 *     given up for whatever reason.
 *
 *  converged:
 *     This flag is set whenever the entire system has converged.  The
 *     convergence will be genuine (all relations satisfied within
 *     tolerance, all bounds satisfied, all calculations defined, etc.).
 *
 *  diverged:
 *     This flag is set whenever the solver has truly given up (i.e. given
 *     up for any reason not covered below).
 *
 *  inconsistent:
 *     The solver has concluded unambiguously (e.g. by symbolic
 *     manipulation) that the system is inconsistent.
 *
 *  calc_ok:
 *     Specifies whether or not there were any calculation errors in
 *     computing the residuals at the current point.
 *
 *  iteration_limit_exceeded:
 *     Specifies whether or not the iteration count was exceeded or not.
 *
 *  time_limit_exceeded:
 *     Specifies whether or not the cpu time limit was exceeded.
 *
 *  panic:
 *     Specifies whether or not the user called a halt interactively;
 *
 *  iteration:
 *     Total number of iterations so far.  Total iteration count is reset to
 *     zero whenever slv_presolve or slv_resolve is called.
 *
 *  cpu_elapsed:
 *     Total number of cpu seconds elapsed.  Total cpu time elapsed is reset
 *     to zero whenever slv_presolve or slv_resolve is called.
 *
 *  block.number_of:
 *     Number of blocks in system.
 *
 *  block.current_block:
 *     Block number of the current block that the solver is working on.
 *     It is assumed that all previous blocks have already converged.
 *
 *  block.current_size:
 *     Number of variables/relations in the current block.
 *
 *  block.previous_total_size:
 *     Total size of previous blocks (= number of variables/relations
 *     already converged).
 *
 *  block.iteration:
 *     Number of iterations so far in the current block.
 *
 *  block.functime:
 *     Number of cpu seconds elapsed getting residuals from whereever.
 *
 *  block.jactime:
 *     Number of cpu seconds elapsed getting jacobians from whereever.
 *
 *  block.cpu_elapsed:
 *     Number of cpu seconds elapsed so far in the current block.
 *
 *  block.residual:
 *     Current residual (RMS value) for the current block.
 *
 *  cost (READ ONLY)
 *    This is a pointer to first of an array which is costsize long of
 *    slv_block_cost structures. This is to collect data for the
 *    comparison of algorithms. All solvers should have at least
 *    one of these, though the interface will check for null before
 *    reading the data. The block_cost structure contains:
 *      size       (how big is the block, in terms of variables)
 *      iterations (how many iterations to convergence/divergence)
 *      funcs      (how many function evaluations were made?)
 *      jacs       (how many jacobian evaluations were made?)
 *      time       (how much cpu total time elapsed while in the block?)
 *      functime   (time spent in function evaluations)
 *      jactime    (time spent in jacobian evaluations, stuffing)
 *                 (for those codes where a function evaluation is
