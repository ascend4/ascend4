	Relation module for the SLV solver.

	This module provides a SLV solver (the "client") with access to
	relations present in the ASCEND compiler (the "server").

	Access to ASCEND relations is abstracted so that SLV solvers
	can theoretically be used to solve other kinds of systems as
	well. @see analyze.h

	04/94 - added rel_apply_filter() which uses the new
			rel_filter_t data structure for perfoming all
			relation filtering needs (eliminating the
			filter module)

	Client (ie a solver) requires:
	#include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
	#include "var.h"

	Server-side use (ie the ASCEND compiler, analyser, etc) requires:
	#include <expr.h> ??
	#include <compiler/expr_types.h> ??
	#include <compiler/extfunc.h>
	#include <compiler/relation.h>
	#include <compiler/packages.h>
	#include <compiler/extcall.h>
	#include "mtx.h"
