/** @page slv SLV Solver Interface

	ASCEND (the language) exists to separate, when desirable, the
	formulation of a mathematical problem (numeric) from the solution of
	the that problem. ASCEND (the interface) exists to give the user as
	much (or as little) control over the compilation and solution of their
	problem as they want. @par
	
	The problems expressible in the language cannot (and indeed should not)
	be reduced to a single formulation if the solutions are to be
	implemented in a robust, efficient, and user controllable manner.
	All but one of the solving engines attached to ASCEND must inevitably
	be hamstrung if we insist that they all fit in the same interface shoebox.
	Witness the minos/lsode implementations in the Pascal-version. The
	alternative is to make all engines talk through an interface defined
	by the intersection of the engines' individual interfaces. This
	alternative is unacceptable from a software engineering point of view. @par
	
	This portion of the interface, then, has the task of making every
	engine conform to a minimum set of semantics (thus enabling the GUI/
	CLUI to support the user wanting very little control over a host of
	powerful solving engines) while giving the power hungry user access
	to those parameters specific to a given engine.
	The minimum semantics chosen, due mostly to convenience and the biases
	of the developers, are those of slv0 with the provision of a set of
	arrays for the passing of auxillary, or 'sub', parameters to each
	solver. @par

	@see slv_common.h for the data structures we desire to have common to all the solvers.

	@section desc Description
	
    The inputs to any solver consist of a formulation of
    the problem to solve along with a set of parameters to
    allow user control of the solution process.  The
    general formulation is given below (for non-discrete
    problems only):

	@code
            min F(x,u,c)

        s.t.  h(x,u,c) = 0
            r(x,u,c) = 0
            g(x,u,c) >= 0
            b(x,u,c) >= 0
	@endcode

    A variable list consists of fixed (c), independent (u),
    dependent variables (x), and unattached variables (q).
    A relation list consists of unconditional (or global)
    equality constraints (h), conditional equality
    constraints (r), and inequality constraints (g), each of
    type struct rel_relation *.  The conditional equalities are
    isolated from the global equalities because they are only
    defined for certain ranges in values of the variables,
    expressed through a set of inequality boundary relations
    (b), each of type bnd_boundary_t which may or may not
    be satisfied at any given point.  An objective function
    (F) is used to provide a criteria with which to
    optimize the values of the independent variables. @par

    The objective function is a relation (LHS only)
    struct rel_relation * and may be set (its default is NULL)
    using slv_set_obj_relation.  The variable, boundary, and
    relation lists are pointer lists of
    struct var_variable * and struct rel_relation * and
    are expected to be NULL terminated.  This means that for
    10 variables to be placed in a list, for example, 11
    elements must exist in order to reserve the last pointer
    to be NULL.  These lists ARE REQUIRED to be set. @par

    The additional set of inputs are the slv_parameters.
    These can specify stopping conditions or the amount of
    information displayed during solving, for example.
    Monitoring of the solution process is done using the
    status report for solvers that iterate.
    More details are given with the
    respective declarations below. @par

	@section arch Architecture
	
	Right, so we're going to have a client-server, object-oriented,
	open-architecture system designed to handle multiple clients in a
	single-thread process. Furthermore, the clients will NOT have to
	know anything at all about the ASCEND IV compiler hidden out back
	some place -- in fact our compiler may not BE out back, it may be
	on another machine or swapped to disk or whatever.
	
	That's the ideal. In most applications of ASCEND, particularly the
	interactive one, the compiler is never very far away. Isolating the
	compiler data completely (meaning no looking back at it for anything)
	would mean recreating all the relations (be they tokens, calls to
	C code, or any kind) in a separate process. This is unacceptable from
	a memory conservation point of view until RAM comes down to ~$1/MByte,
	especially if ASCEND is to run on PCs any time soon.

	Haha :-) $1/MB! Jan 2006: 118 AUD = 512 MB = ~ 0.15 USD/MB -- johnpye
	
	What we really have then is a slv_system_t made up of variables and
	relations and hiding all the compiler details from the clients.
	Clients will operate directly on the slv_system_t only through real
	C functions and not through macros so we can hide all the nasty
	details about the compiler. Variables and relations only make
	sense in the context of a slv_system_t, so the var_variable type
	and the rel_relation type in this C code sometimes require that
	the system pointer be provided when asking for certain properties
	or services.
	
	@section faq FAQ

	@subsection whatisvar What is a variable?
	The question is ambiguous. In ASCEND we have the notion of a
	solver_var ATOM type that includes bounding values, a scaling
	value, and other properties. These are not the only real-number
	based items that can occur, however. For purposes of the CLIENT
	application programming interface (API) we collect all the real-
	based objects we can find and map them all to struct var_variable.
	See var.h for details. We sort them into lists as follows:
	    - vars.  These are solver_var that are in an objective or relation.
	    - pars.  These are solver_par appearing parametrically.
	    - unattached.  These don't appear in relation or objective, and
	                they may be solver_var or solver_par or neither.
	We keep 2 versions of each list: one for ourselves which is READ-
	ONLY for clients and allows us to do many things efficiently, and
	another for clients that clients may rearrange (or even delete)
	as suits their needs. The former version is called a master list,
	and the latter version is called a solvers list.
	
	@subsection whatisrel What is a relation?
	At present a relation in ASCEND is either an objective function
	(a one-sided relation) or a constraining equation. We have a
	variety of relation implementations within ASCEND, but all any
	client needs to know about relations can be found in the rel.h
	file. We keep master and client lists of relations as well.
	We provide a variety of interesting services with relations:
	 - residual and gradient calculations
	 - symbolic inversion (where possible)
	 - numeric root finding
	 - scaling based on symbolic arguments
	 - symbolic determination of linearity
	and we expect to add others as they occur to us or you suggest
	them.
	
	 @subsection whatisslvsys What else is a slv_system_t?
	 It's has a host of interesting properties.
	  - One slv_system_t (system, hereafter) can only be used by one
		*registered* client at a time, but if your client is an unregistered manager
	    of several subclients (for example an NLP code and and MILP code)
		then you can pass it back and forth to those registered clients to solve
		an MINLP. (Note: we haven't done this ourselves yet.)
		Any number of unregistered clients may share a system, but they
		must take responsibility for not stepping on each other or the
		registered client. Registration will be explained further below.
	  - From any given ASCEND type definitions, the master lists in the
	    system will be ordered identically across all invocations of
	    ASCEND on any hardware that we are aware of. This property is
	    derived from the way we compile instances and create systems.
	    This is helpful in benchmarking and other applications.
	  - We have a number of standard clients (registered and not)
	    you can use on a the system to precondition it in some way for
	    your client:
	      - Degrees of freedom analysis.
	      - Problem decomposition.
	      - Reordering of vars and rels for good factorization.
	      - Solution of square nonlinear systems.
	      - Generation of MPS code for popular MILP solvers.
	      - Generation of GAMS code for an old, slow compiler of an
	        extremely awkward modeling language that does happen to
	        have a lot of really good optimizers connected.
	
	@TODO Short term, we expect to construct a client that takes the partitioned
	problem and hands off the blocks in sequence to one or more
	solvers designed to handle only 1 block.
	
	@TODO Long term, we anticipate that the structure laid out so far is capable of
	expansion (probably by intermediate clients which add additional
	semantic content) to provide standardized (mtx and harwellian)
	sparse matrix support and memory management for codes that don't
	care to think about such things directly.
	
	@NOTE
		We are going through a solver API definition restructuring.
		The appearance of NOTEs in the header means the code in question
		has, or is about to have, a change in its meaning or is code that
		is new and replaces some or all the functionality of an old
		function definition. Basically, expect to have to read NOTE sections
		carefully and maybe patch calls dependent on them.

	@li	 any parameter except "partition".
	@li  variable values.
	@li  variable nominal values.
	@li  variable bounds.

	In particular, the following changes are NOT allowed:

	@li  variable fixed flag.
	@li  relation included flag.
	@li  variable/relation list contents, including order.  Also, the 
		variable/relation indices must continue to be consistent with
		the list.
	@li  definition of relations, objective function, and boundaries:
		including structural rearrangement on relations, although any
		expression may be simplified.

	This function is considerably more efficient when it is usable.
