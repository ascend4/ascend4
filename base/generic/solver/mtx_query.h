 ***  If nz.row is not in the matrix (<0 || >= mtx order) on an initial

 ***  Example of canonical usage:                                       <pre>

 ***
 ***  NOTE: The notion of "next non-zero" is arbitrary, but will not change
 ***  until the next destructive operation on the matrix is performed.
 ***  Neither the row/col number nor the rel/var index will
 ***  behave monotonically while traversing a col/row. This means there
 ***  is nothing you can do with the range to shrink the search space
 ***  based on the last row/col returned. Basic matrix operations, when
 ***  properly thought about in a general sparse context, do not care
 ***  about the order in which the elements of vectors are processed.
 ***  <pre>
 ***  WARNINGS:
 !1!  - You may NOT nest mtx_next_in_col within mtx_next_in_col
 ! !    or mtx_next_in_row within mtx_next_in_row. We have yet to find a
 ! !    process suggestive of doing so that was not better handled with
 ! !    a for loop. This is a global constraint. Violation results in garbage.
 !2!  - You may NOT safely perform operation mtx_del_zr_in_col while traversing
 ! !    a column unless the value just returned from the previous next_in_col is
 ! !    nonzero or the coord.row last returned is mtx_LAST. Also, you may NOT
 ! !    safely perform operation mtx_del_zr_in_row on coord.row unless the
 ! !    value just returned from the previous next_in_col is nonzero.
 ! !    The proscription here is for mtx_next_in_ and mtx_del_zr_in_ operating
 ! !    on the same matrix. mtx_del_zr_in_ is safe to call if the mtx_next_in_
 ! !    driving it is happening on a different matrix.
 !3!  Transpose warning 2 for next_in_row.
 ! !  Violation of 2 or 3 results, sooner or later, in a memory fault.
 ***  You CAN nest mtx_next_in_col within mtx_next_in_row or vice versa,
 ***  however.
