/** @file
 *  System routines for the SLV solver.
 *  <pre>
 *  Contents:     System module (ascend)
 *
 *  Authors:      Joseph Zaher
 *
 *  Dates:        04/94 - original version by Joe Zaher
 *                06/96 - original total reimplementation by Ben Allan
 *
 *  Description:  This is the ascend version of the system module.
 *                This provides a means of extracting a solver system
 *                from an ASCEND instance tree.
 *                The result is supposed to appear totally instance
 *                independent, though it is not really, so that
 *                only the var and rel modules need to know about
 *                the ascend compiler.
 *                With any luck the expr, exprman, and relman files leave.
 *
 *  Requires:     #include "utilities/ascConfig.h"
 *                #include "slv_types.h"
 *  </pre>
