    are provided as yet. The deallocation of sparse vectors is
    the user's job. See the notes at the top of this header for the
    data semantics of a sparse vector.
    The user may construct a sparse vector.
    Calls which return a sparse vector may create or use and return
    a user supplied sparse vector. These calls are at liberty to
    reallocate the data memory if that supplied is insufficient to
    hold the data. The len and cap values of the vector will be reset
    as appropriate.

    Functions do not create a sparse unless it says in their header
    that mtx_CREATE_SPARSE is a valid argument.
