 ***  Backends that provide the residuals, gradients, and so forth

 ***  In the case of ASCEND, this is a struct Instance *.
 ***  Since we want the Slv interface to appear totally backend
 ***  independent (in particular because it is convenient), we
 ***  define our interface in terms of SlvBackendTokens.
 ***  Any backend can be connected by an appropriate set of
 ***  routines conforming to the headers of slv_*, rel.h, var.h
 ***  and system.h.<br><br>
 ***
 ***  We haven't yet been able to think through the possibilities of
 ***  having multiple backends operating _simultaneously_, mainly
 ***  because the ASCEND backend is quite capable of wrapping all
 ***  the other backends we can think of.
