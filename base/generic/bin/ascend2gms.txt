After having successfully solved a square problem, run the
following command from the command line.

dbg_calc_relnoms

This procedure calculates the nominals for the relations.
This will help GAMS with scaling the problem.  After having
done this, running the following command from the command
line

dbg_write_slv0_sys filename

Where filename is the name of the file you want to generate.
For example, if I want to generate a file called preprocess, I 
would type the following

dbg_write_slv0_sys preprocess

After having generated the file to be processed, invoke the 
following command from a shell prompt.

ascend2gms.pl input

The input is the name of the file you want to parse. In the 
previous example, this is preprocess.  The script will 
automatically generate a file called preprocess.gms, which 
is the GAMS input file and a file called preprocess.lk which
contains the actual ASCEND variables and there associated 
variables used in the GAMS input file. 

The GAMS file that is created is assumed to be a  nonlinear program.  
The current working version of ascend2gms.pl does not handle integer
variables YET!  The user must fill in an appropriate objective
function.  The equation obj1.. is provided. The default is to 
minimize the objective function using NLP.  This could be changed
by the user if the MODEL happens to be linear.

Once the objective function has been supplied, the user will need
 to free additional variables in order to solve a non-square
system of equations.
