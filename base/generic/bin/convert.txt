The following file converts the gams output using the
substitute variables into an output file using the 
actual variables.

convertoutput.pl

The command line syntax is the following (the <> are not redirects):

convertoutput.pl <file to be converted> <MODEL name from ASCEND>

This program uses the lookup file that is created when
ascend2gms.pl is run. The program automatically generates a 
a file with the same base as the file to be converted, but with a
.con file extension.

Example:
convert the file column.lst (the GAMS output list file) to an 
output file with the actual ASCEND variables. the name of the 
ASCEND MODEL was t1

        convertoutput.pl column.lst t1

the output file generated with then be 

        column.con

If the user has requested GAMS to display certain variables using 
something like:

display aa.l;

where aa is the reflux ratio in the column MODEL.
The display lines will show up in the gams list file like the 
following:

        330 -- aa.l     = 1

Currently, if the user places a carriage return between the 
330 -- and the aa.l     = 1 so the file know looks like:

        330 --
                aa.l    = 1

When the GAMS list file is converted the following lines will 
show up at the end of the *.con file:

        ASSIGN {t1.column.reflux_ratio} 1;

The user can easily cut and paste this line into her script 
window and run the command on her ASCEND MODEL.
