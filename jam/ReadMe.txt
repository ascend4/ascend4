The files in this directory support building the Ascend
libraries and executables using the jam* build tool.

The following files are included:

  Jamrules_general.in - configuration & custom build rules used by Jamfiles
  Jambase             - lightly customized version of standard build rules
                        (primarily to shore up support for different compilers)

The Ascend jam build system currently supports building under Windows 
using the MSVC, Borland, MinGW, and Watcom** compilers, and under
Linux using gcc/g77.  With use of the included Jambase file, it should 
work with both the original and ftjam variants of jam.  
The system was developed primarily using ftjam.

Automatic processing of Jamrules_general.in to Jamrules_general by 
configure is not currently implemented.  Until it is, users will 
need to manually copy Jamrules_general.in to Jamrules_general and 
edit Jamrules to match their preferenes & configuration.

Build Instructions

1. jam must be installed and configured for the compiler in use.

2. Copy Jamrules_general.in to Jamrules_general.

3. Manually edit Jamrules_general to set configuration and local 
   directory options.  These settings are used by all the Jamfiles
   in the Ascend source tree.

4. Follow the instructions in the particular Jamfile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:

* jam is an open source, multi-platform build tool
which is available in several flavors.  These include
the original (http://www.perforce.com) and ftjam
(http://www.freetype.org/jam/index.html) variants,
among others.

** Currently, Open Watcom 1.3 can compile the Ascend sources
and build the libraries.  However, it does not supply the required
IEEE math functions isnan() and copysign().  At present, Ascend does
not supply these, so the user must provide these functions to use
the libraries under Watcom.
